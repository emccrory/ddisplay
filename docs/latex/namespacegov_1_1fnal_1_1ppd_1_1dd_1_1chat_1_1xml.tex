\subsection{Detailed Description}
Fermilab's Dynamic Displays System -- Implementation of pure X\-M\-L documents for messages. 

Some of the aspects of the envisioned conversion here are\-: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The socket communication must change from sending streamed objects to sending A\-S\-C\-I\-I text in the form of X\-M\-L documents 
\item The X\-M\-L document must be signed, within the X\-M\-L itself 
\item The marshalling and unmarshalling is on the X\-M\-L document. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The messaging scheme as it exists today (first half of 2019) works like this\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The messages are Java objects that represent the X\-M\-L documents 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Thus, the marshalling and unmarshalling, of X\-M\-L documents as specified above, does not need to change much. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The X\-M\-L document object is signed by Java libraries, creating a java.\-security.\-Signed\-Object 
\item The signed Java object is streamed through a socket 
\end{DoxyItemize}

At this time (September, 2016), this is an incomplete (test) implementation of the classes to do the messaging in the system. The idea is that these classes would only output X\-M\-L documents, and these X\-M\-L documents are the actual information that is transmitted over the Internet between the clients. Currently, Java Objects are streamed between the clients. 

There was some effort on this through 2018, but the author got confusing and this effort stopped. This M\-U\-S\-T be restarted in 2019 and brought to some conclusion. 

This implementation might be necessary when Oracle deprecates object streaming. This is alledged to happen with the release of Java 9 (2021??)

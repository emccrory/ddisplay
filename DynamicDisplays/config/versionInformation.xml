    <versionDescription>Add more diagnostics to the MessagingServer.  Cleaned up a couple of GUI elements in ChannelSelector (they were being constructed all the time - now they are only constructed once).  Change the name of one of the classes to (hopefully) be more meaningful.  Add a couple more tests in the Jenkinsfile.  This will turn into a PRODUCTION release after a little more testing.</versionDescription>

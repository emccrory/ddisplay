    <versionDescription>Refactoring .. a lot of refactoring.

1. I tried to rationalize the Channel List classes
2. I broke up three of the largest sub-packages:
   a. util becomes 3 new packages
   b. channel - several classes moved to one of the util packages
   c. move all instances of messages into xml.messages

Eclipse should have done all the re-wiring; running the ChannelSelector works fine.</versionDescription>

<b> [Structural Biology] CRISPR Cas9 molecular scissors</b>:  The CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein Cas9 is a molecular scissor for cutting DNA. The first step in the cutting reaction is the RNA-guided unwinding of the DNA double helix. Jiang  et ... 
<b> [Organic Chemistry] A route to nitrile that bypasses cyanide</b>:  The toxicity of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is well known. Nonetheless, numerous useful nitrile compounds contain CN groups, and the reaction of HCN with C=C double bonds is often used. ... 
<b> [Applied Physics] Sensing single proteins with diamonds</b>:  Nuclear magnetic resonance is a powerful technique for medical imaging and the structural analysis of materials, but is usually associated with large-volume samples. Lovchinsky  et ... 
<b> [Nanomaterials] Dynamic DNA clustering of nanoparticles</b>:  The size and shape of nanoparticles can increase the cellular uptake and delivery of contrast agents and therapeutics. Ohta  et al.  created gold nanoparticles partly covered ... 
<b> [Mucosal Immunology] Keeping immune cells quiet on a diet</b>:  Over thousands of years, our immune systems has evolved to distinguish self from foreign, perpetrating attacks on microbes but not ourselves. Given this, why do we fail to mount an ... 
<b> [DNA Repair] The real cause of cancer in Fanconi anemia</b>:  Mutations that covalently link the two strands of the DNA double helix together are highly toxic, because they block DNA replication. Failure to repair such damage results in Fanconi ... 
<b> [Neuroscience] Glial cell properties dictated by neurons</b>:  Neurons in the brain coexist with astrocytes, a type of glial cell, which help support many functions of their neighboring nerve cells. Farmer  et al.  now show that the support ... 
<b> [Seismology] Crowdsourcing earthquake early warnings</b>:  The rapid distribution of earthquake warnings can reduce resulting loss of life and injury. Most earthquake early warning systems are based on data from specially designed seismic and ... 
<b> [Cancer] Killing cancer with a soft touch</b>:  Bleomycin is an effective chemotherapy drug that is used against multiple types of cancer. Unfortunately, it often causes lung fibrosis (or stiffening of the lungs), the severity of ... 
<b> [Microbiome] Microbiota and infant development</b>:  Malnutrition in children is a persistent challenge that is not always remedied by improvements in nutrition. This is because a characteristic community of gut microbes seems to mediate ... 
<b> [Proteasome] The yin and yang of proteasomal regulation</b>:  The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates myriad proteins through their selective proteolysis. The small protein ubiquitin is attached, typically in many copies, to the target protein, ... 
<b> [Structural Biology] AAA ATPase conformational high jinks</b>:  The protein p97 is an AAA adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) that uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to regulate substrates involved in intracellular protein quality control. Its role in ... 
<b> [Structural Biology] Insight into a bacterial membrane protease</b>:  Lipoproteins have key functions in many bacteria. They are synthesized in a precursor form that requires processing by enzymes that are essential in many pathogenic bacteria but have ... 
<b> [Ion Channels] Calcium channels deliver a one-two punch</b>:  To help generate long-lasting neuronal plasticity, CaV1.2 (L-type) calcium channels link electrical activity to nuclear gene expression. However, exactly how this coupling works is ... 
<b> [Infectious Diseases] Preparing for the next epidemic</b>:  As West Africa emerges from the Ebola epidemic that caused over 11,000 deaths, the next epidemic is emerging in Central and South America, where the rapid spread of Zika virus infections ... 
<b> [Immunometabolism] Unleashing natural killer cells</b>:  The cytokine TGF-β can resolve inflammation and prevent autoimmunity, but it can also inhibit anti-tumor immune responses. Viel  et al.  found that TGF-β signaling suppressed t ...

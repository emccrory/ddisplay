<b> [Electron Transport] Electrons that flow like a fluid</b>:  Electrons inside a conductor are often described as flowing in response to an electric field. This flow rarely resembles anything like the familiar flow of water through a pipe, but ... 
<b> [Superconductivity] Resolving the thermoelectric paradox</b>:  The existence of thermoelectric effects in superconductors has posed a particularly difficult challenge for physicists. Not only have experiments and theory been in paradoxical discrepancy ... 
<b> [Ebola Virus] Profiling the antibody response to Ebola</b>:  The recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa illustrates the need not only for a vaccine but for potential therapies, too. One promising therapy is monoclonal antibodies that target ... 
<b> [Immunology] Diversity reigns in antibody responses</b>:  During the course of an immune response, B cells specific for an invading pathogen divide. The antibodies they produce increase in affinity via somatic mutation in specialized lymph ... 
<b> [Gene Expression] Doubling DNA but not expression</b>:  As the genome replicates, and before the cell divides, the copy number of the replicated portions of the genome doubles. In bacteria and archaea, gene expression tracks with gene dosage, ... 
<b> [Cell Biology] Separating dividing cells into two</b>:  By activating genes involved in cell growth and proliferation, the transcriptional coactivator YAP can act as a tumor promoter. Bui  et al.  uncovered a nontranscriptional role ... 
<b> [Catalysis] Small olefins from syngas</b>:  . This mixture, known as syngas, is then converted to ... 
<b> [Human Altruism] Brain activity shows underlying motives</b>:  In humans, two completely different motives may nevertheless lead to exactly the same behavior. Because we can't directly observe motives, modern economists often completely disregard ... 
<b> [Flexible Electronics] Make it stretch, make it glow</b>:  The skins of some cephalopods, such as the octopus, are highly flexible and contain color-changing cells. These cells are loaded with pigments that enable rapid and detailed camouflaging ... 
<b> [Structural Biology] A more complete look at the HIV-1 envelope</b>:  HIV-1 uses its envelope protein (Env), a large glycoprotein present on the viral surface, to enter target cells. Env forms trimers on the viral surface. Structural studies of solubilized ... 
<b> [Immunogenomics] Regulatory use of endogenous retroviruses</b>:  Mammalian genomes contain many endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which have a range of evolutionary ages. The propagation and maintenance of these genetic elements have been attributed ... 
<b> [Fibrosis] SRC shows it stripes</b>:  The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase SRC is a proto-oncogene that has been associated with cancer progression. Turro  et al.  found a gain-of-function mutation in SRC in nine patients ... 
<b> [Neural Computation] Credit assignment in the brain</b>:  To discover relevant clues for survival, an organism must bridge the gap between the short time periods when a clue occurs and the potentially long waiting times after which feedback ... 
<b> [DNA Repair] To have or have not determines DNA repair</b>:  Cells presumably try to protect DNA from damage at all costs. But Uphof  et al.  show that they do not, because the cost is too high. Single-molecule and single-cell measurements ... 
<b> [Transcription] Choosing where to start transcription</b>:  The RNA polymerase enzyme complex binds to the promoter of a gene and separates the two DNA strands. The subsequently formed “transcription bubble” is required for RNA synthesis to  ... 
<b> [Quantum Computing] Reducing quantum overhead</b>:  A quantum computer is expected to outperform its classical counterpart in certain tasks. One such task is the factorization of large integers, the technology that underpins the security ... 
<b> [Cancer Biology] Have cancer stem cells MET their match?</b>:  Solid tumors have been hypothesized to contain a subset of highly aggressive cells that fuel tumor growth and metastasis. The search is on for drugs that selectively kill or diminish ...

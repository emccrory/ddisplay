<b> [Emerging Diseases] Small bats in damp places doomed</b>:  Emerging diseases are often selective killers. White nose syndrome (WNS), for example, is caused by a fungal pathogen that kills bats by disrupting hibernation. Introduced to North ... 
<b> [Structural Biology] A bacterial defense mechanism</b>:  Polymoxins are antibiotics that disrupt the bacterial cell membrane and are used to treat multidrug-resistant infections. A bacterial enzyme called ArnT can mediate resistance to polymoxins ... 
<b> [Materials Science] Controlled colloid bonding using DNA</b>:  Colloidal particles can act as analogs of atoms for studying crystallization and packing behavior, but they don't naturally bond together the way atoms do. Short strands of DNA are ... 
<b> [Spintronics] Manipulating a stubborn magnet</b>:  Spintronics is an alternative to conventional electronics, based on using the electron's spin rather than its charge. Spintronic devices, such as magnetic memory, have traditionally ... 
<b> [Forest Management] Europe's managed forests contribute to warming</b>:  For most of the past 250 years, surprisingly it seems that Europe's managed forests have been a net source of carbon, contributing to climate warming rather than mitigating it. Naudts ... 
<b> [Honey Bee Disease] Varroa-vectored virus pandemic</b>:  Bees are facing several threats that are causing population collapses. Wilfert et al. found that European honey bees are the primary source of deformed wing virus (DWV) (see ... 
<b> [Heart Disease] Powering down yields a healthier heart</b>:  In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the heart muscle enlarges and becomes progressively less efficient at pumping blood. HCM can be caused by mutations in components of the sarcomere ... 
<b> [Cancer] Metastatic breast tumors break down bone</b>:  Most breast cancer cells activate the breakdown of bone to promote metastases. Wang et al. found that the ABL kinases enhanced the ability of breast cancer cells to invade ... 
<b> [Batteries] Why batteries go bad</b>:  Rechargeable batteries are found in a range of everyday devices, from shavers and laptops to cars and airplanes. Over time, these batteries can fail, either through a gradual loss of ... 
<b> [Stem Cells] Quiescent and aging hair follicle stem cells</b>:  Stem cells enable normal cell homeostasis, but they also exist in a quiescent state, ready to proliferate and differentiate after tissue damage. Now, two studies reveal features of ... 
<b> [Superconductivity] Disentangling intertwined orders</b>:  In copper oxide superconductors, several types of order compete for supremacy. In addition to superconductivity, researchers have found periodic patterns in charge density (CDW order), ... 
<b> [Ice Sheets] Keeping a stiff upper layer</b>:  The interior of the Greenland Ice Sheet is growing thicker, in contrast to the thinning that is occurring at its edges. Why? MacGregor et al. conclude that more snow is accumulating ... 
<b> [Cancer] The more the merrier</b>:  Monoclonal antibodies against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which drives tumor growth, are frequently used to treat colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, the cancers commonly ... 
<b> [Climate Change] It's not only the carbon in the trees</b>:  Forest loss affects climate not just because of the impacts it has on the carbon cycle, but also because of how it affects the fluxes of energy and water between the land and the atmosphere. ... 
<b> [Cancer Therapeutics] Cancer therapy by entrapment</b>:  oncogene occur at high frequency in several of the most lethal human cancers, including lung and pancreatic cancer. Substantial effort has thus been directed ...

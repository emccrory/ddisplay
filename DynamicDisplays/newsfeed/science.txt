<b> [Magnetohydrodynamics] Simulating turbulent solar magnetic fields</b>:  An accurate simulation of solar magnetic fields must reproduce both the large-scale dynamo and small-scale turbulence. Simply increasing the computational resolution does not always ... 
<b> [C–H Bond Activation] Methane borylation in a cyclohexane sea</b>:  Although methane combusts readily at high temperatures, it is generally the hardest hydrocarbon to transform under gentler conditions, owing to its particularly strong C–H bonds. C ... 
<b> [Solar Cells] Perovskite solar cells recycle photons</b>:  Inorganic-organic perovskite solar cells are very efficient in part because the charge carriers exhibit very long path lengths. Pazos-Outón  et al.  show that photon recycling,  ... 
<b> [Structural Biology] A human spliceosomal subcomplex</b>:  The spliceosome is an RNA and protein molecular machine that cuts out introns from messenger RNAs. Agafonov  et al.  used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure ... 
<b> [Economics] Another social science looks at itself</b>:  Experimental economists have joined the reproducibility discussion by replicating selected published experiments from two top-tier journals in economics. Camerer  et al.  found ... 
<b> [Memory Formation] Coding what is known and what is new</b>:  Do neural activity patterns during sleep reflect the replay of a novel experience or an invariant preexisting dynamic? Grosmark and Buzsáki observed that both familiar and novel aspects  ... 
<b> [Cloud Formation] Organic contributions to cloud theory</b>:  Current theories about the formation of cloud droplets from aerosol particles containing organic components assume that the organic molecules are distributed throughout the droplet. ... 
<b> [Tumor Immunology] The cellular ancestry of tumor antigens</b>:  One contributing factor in antitumor immunity is the repertoire of neoantigens created by genetic mutations within tumor cells. Like the corresponding mutations, these neoantigens show ... 
<b> [Cancer] The spread of bad neighborhoods</b>:  Our genomes have complex three-dimensional (3D) arrangements that partition and regulate gene expression. Cancer cells frequently have their genomes grossly rearranged, disturbing this ... 
<b> [Forest Ecosystems] Forest recovery in China is not so clear cut</b>:  Frequently in developing nations, forests shrink as trees are cut and agriculture expands. This trend does not tend to reverse until significant economic development and urbanization ... 
<b> [Synthetic Biology] Designing and building a minimal genome</b>:  A goal in biology is to understand the molecular and biological function of every gene in a cell. One way to approach this is to build a minimal genome that includes only the genes ... 
<b> [Transporter Function] A proton pump in action</b>:  P-type adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to pump cations across biological membranes. The electrochemical gradients that are generated control many ... 
<b> [Physiological Ecology] Variability for a day or a season</b>:  Species that experience larger seasonal climatic fluctuations are likely to be more physiologically flexible and thus likely to occur across a wider elevational range. Daily changes ... 
<b> [Protein Evolution] Variation and transcription factor binding</b>:  Little is known about the phenotypic and functional effects of genetic variants that result in amino acid changes within functional proteins. Barrera  et al.  investigated whether ... 
<b> [DFT Methods] A comparison of DFT methods</b>:  Density functional theory (DFT) is now routinely used for simulating material properties. Many software packages are available, which makes it challenging to know which are the best ... 
<b> [HIV-1 Vaccines] Baby steps toward bNAbs</b>:  Some HIV-infected individuals develop heavily mutated, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that target HIV. Scientists aim to design vaccines that would elicit such antibodies. ... 
<b> [Neurodevelopment] Tracking neuronal transcriptional programs</b>:  Early in brain development, cortical neurons are born near the ventricles, then migrate to their functional destinations. Telley  et al.  used a fluorescent labeling technique ... 
<b> [Cardiovascular Biology] A GRK2 peptide prevents heart failure</b>:  During cardiac hypertrophy, sustained high blood pressure causes the heart walls to thicken to deal with the increased load. If left unchecked, cardiac hypertrophy leads to heart failure. ... 
<b> [Autoimmunity] A glucose balancing act</b>:  In autoimmune diseases, T cells engage their hyperdrive, both proliferating and secreting inflammatory cytokines at greater rates than normal. Little is known about the metabolic changes ...

<b> [Ice Sheets] Sensitive ice sheets</b>:  Why did the Antarctic Ice Sheet begin to grow 34 million years ago, and what does that have to do with us? Galeotti  et al.  studied a marine sediment core recovered from just ... 
<b> [Obesity] Cell-free DNA and adipose tissue inflammation</b>:  Obesity can induce chronic inflammation and subsequent insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes), but how this happens has been a nagging question. Nishimoto  et al.  found that degenerating ... 
<b> [Mitochondrial Disease] Thriving on a breath of low oxygen</b>:  Mitochondrial diseases are debilitating and largely untreatable. Most are caused by genetic mutations that impair the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which generates cellular energy. ... 
<b> [Flow Chemistry] Drug manufacturing in a fridge-sized box</b>:  Commodity chemicals tend to be manufactured in a continuous fashion. However, the preparation of pharmaceuticals still proceeds batch by batch, partly on account of the complexity of ... 
<b> [Immune Regulation] Long noncoding RNAs in inflammation</b>:  Growing evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important modulators of gene expression. Castellanos-Rubio  et al.  identified a lncRNA, lnc13, that suppresses ... 
<b> [Conflict Behavior] How to win a fish fight</b>:  When to cease aggression and escape is an important decision that fighting animals must make. Chou  et al.  characterized the role of two nuclei in a brain area of the zebrafish ... 
<b> [Stellar Evolution] Discovery of an oxygen white dwarf</b>:  The vast majority of stars will eventually evolve into a white dwarf, a small, hot, and extremely dense object made of leftover material from the star's core. Stellar evolution theory ... 
<b> [Mammalian Germ Cells] Mouse oocytes receive sister cell factors</b>:  Mammalian mature oocytes, the largest cells in the body, are capable of programming and reprogramming embryogenesis. Only about 20% of developing mouse germ cells become oocytes. Lei ... 
<b> [Pain] “WNK”ing away chronic pain</b>:  WNK1 is a kinase found in the spinal cord's dorsal horn, which transmits pain signals from the periphery to the brainstem. Mutations in the  HSN2  exon in the gene encoding WNK1 ... 
<b> [Cell Death Pathways] Apoptosis, necrosis, and pyroptosis</b>:  The routes to cell death are many, and distinguishing which path a particular cell may have taken remains a challenge. Wallach  et al.  review current understanding of how programmed ... 
<b> [Nonhuman Genomics] Improving on the gorilla genome</b>:  Access to complete, high-quality genomes of nonhuman primates will also help us understand human biology. Gordon  et al.  used long-read sequencing technology to improve genome ... 
<b> [Synthetic Biology] Programming circuitry for synthetic biology</b>:  As synthetic biology techniques become more powerful, researchers are anticipating a future in which the design of biological circuits will be similar to the design of integrated circuits ... 
<b> [Colloidal Ordering] Competing forces drive ordering</b>:  The power and beauty of liquid crystals come from their tendency to order loosely over long length scales. This ordering can be tweaked using external fields, or via tailored boundary ... 
<b> [Electrocatalysis] A lanthanide boost for platinum</b>:  High loadings of precious platinum are needed for automotive fuel cells, because the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are relatively slow. Escudero-Escribano  et al.  ... 
<b> [Organic Chemistry] Beyond textbook SN2 chemistry</b>:  In one of best-studied organic reactions, a negatively charged ion such as chlorine replaces another atom or group of atoms in an organic molecule. According to the traditional understanding ... 
<b> [Atmospheric Methane] Getting a rise out of agriculture</b>:  Methane, a powerful and important greenhouse gas, has been accumulating nearly uninterruptedly in the atmosphere for the past 200 years, with the exception of a mysterious plateau between ... 
<b> [Climate Change] Birds populations allied in abundance</b>:  Changes in climate can cause populations of species to decline, to increase, or to remain steady. Stephens  et al.  looked across species of common birds in Europe and the United ... 
<b> [Inflammation] Guarding inflammation</b>:  The innate immune system is genetically hardwired in each of us to protect against infection. Mutations in these protective genes can lead to uncontrolled inflammation and disease. ... 
<b> [Immunology] Dialing down allergic responses</b>:  Immunity to parasites and worms, termed type 2 immunity, is a double-edged sword. The same immune cells that keep these pests at bay can go awry, causing allergy and asthma. Chan  et ...

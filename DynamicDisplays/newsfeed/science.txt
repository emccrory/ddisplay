<b> [Feeding Behavior] When enough isn't enough</b>:  Overeating and obesity are rapidly becoming worldwide problems. Normally, mice do not overeat—they balance their caloric intake with their caloric needs. Lagerlöf  et al.  de ... 
<b> [Superconductivity] Peeking into a diamond pressure cell</b>:  A defining characteristic of a superconductor is that it expels an external magnetic field. Demonstrating this effect can be tricky when the sample is under enormous pressures in a ... 
<b> [Vascular Biology] Reelin in leukocytes for atherosclerosis</b>:  In the circulation, the secreted protein Reelin acts to stem bleeding after injury. Receptors for Reelin are found on the endothelial cells that line blood vessels. Ding  et al.  ... 
<b> [Microbiota] Mom's bugs shape of spring immunity</b>:  In utero, babies are relatively microbe-free but are quickly colonized at birth. These early microbial residents help to shape our immune systems. Gomez de Agüero  et al.  wondered  ... 
<b> [Hydrogen Bonding] Gear-like rotation by a wobbly water duo</b>:  The molecules in liquid water move about constantly, but on average they cling to each other through hydrogen bonds, like dancers who keep switching partners. Richardson  et al.  ... 
<b> [Gas Infrastructure] The magnitude of a major methane leak</b>:  The Aliso Canyon underground gas storage facility outside Los Angeles, CA, houses enormous natural gas reserves. One well at the site experienced a blowout in late October 2015 and ... 
<b> [Ebola Virus] Antibodies block Ebola virus entry</b>:  The recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa illustrates the need for both an effective vaccine and therapies to treat infected individuals. Corti  et al.  isolated two monoclonal ... 
<b> [Inflammation] A prostaglandin barrier to inflammation</b>:  Blood-borne bacterial infections and severe trauma can send the immune system into overdrive, causing it to pump out inflammatory mediators, sometimes at lethal doses. Duffin  et ... 
<b> [Surface Science] Durable coatings that repel ice</b>:  Preventing ice buildup on surfaces is crucial for ensuring the proper operation and safety of airplanes, ships, communication towers, and wind turbines. Golovin  et al.  studied ... 
<b> [Chemistry] Temporarily caught in a bind</b>:  When an atom or molecular fragment is covalently bonded, its release is controlled by the rate of degradation of the bond or by the rate of degradation of the matrix or shell material ... 
<b> [Planetary Science] New Horizons unveils the Pluto system</b>:  In July 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft flew through the Pluto system at high speed, humanity's first close look at this enigmatic system on the outskirts of our solar system. In ... 
<b> [Nanomaterials] Creating semiconductor nanocages</b>:  The surface area of nanomaterials can be increased by creating open cage structures. Now it seems that the shape of nanocrystals can be used as a tool to manipulate crystal structure ... 
<b> [Ionic Materials] Transporting the hydrogen anion</b>
<b> [Biochemistry] A radical carboxyl migration</b>:  The antibiotic nosiheptide, produced by  Streptomyces actuosus , has high activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens. The enzymes involved in its biosynthesis include NosL, ... 
<b> [Neuroinflammation] Linking neurodegeneration and immune cells</b>:  The expansion of a repetitive DNA sequence in the C9orf72 gene is the major genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Although the expansion decreases ... 
<b> [Mucosal Immunity] Tuft cells help contain parasites</b>:  Trillions of microbes inhabit our guts, including worms and other parasites. Epithelial cells that line the gut orchestrate parasite-targeted immune responses. Howitt  et al.  ... 
<b> [Antibiotic Resistance] The spectre of untreatable infections</b>:  Antimicrobial resistance is on the rise around the world, in some cases leaving few treatment options. Recent evidence for antimicrobial resistance against a treatment of last resort, ... 
<b> [Infectious Disease] Dengue model rises to the challenge</b>:  Human efficacy testing remains a major hurdle in bringing new vaccine candidates to the clinic. Without accepted correlates of protection, rounds of safety trials must be performed ...

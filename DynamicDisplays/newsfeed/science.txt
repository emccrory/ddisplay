<b> [Cancer] Helping cancer cells exit blood vessels</b>:  Metastasizing cancer cells must migrate into the bloodstream to colonize secondary sites. Locard-Paulet  et al.  cocultured breast cancer cells with endothelial cells, a system ... 
<b> [Photocatalysis] Copper's light touch forges C-N bonds</b>:  Organic photochemistry has traditionally relied on excitation in the ultraviolet, where carbon-based compounds tend to absorb. Over the past decade, the field has undergone a renaissance ... 
<b> [Transcription] The SAGA of removing nucleosomal ubiquitin</b>:  Covalent modifications of histones play a critical role in gene regulation. The addition of the small protein ubiquitin to histone H2B in nucleosomes is a mark of actively transcribed ... 
<b> [Human Genomics] The legacy of human-Neandertal interbreeding</b>:  Non-African humans are estimated to have inherited on average 1.5 to 4% of their genomes from Neandertals. However, how this genetic legacy affects human traits is unknown. Simonti ... 
<b> [Metabolism] Controlling supplies for DNA and RNA synthesis</b>:  The mTORC1 protein kinase complex regulates anabolic metabolism and coordinates cellular signals that promote growth with availability of required precursor metabolites. Signaling through ... 
<b> [Global Water Cycle] By land or by sea</b>:  How much of an effect does terrestrial groundwater storage have on sea-level rise? Reager  et al.  used gravity measurements made between 2002 and 2014 by NASA's Gravity Recovery ... 
<b> [Immunology] An unconventional route to protection</b>:  One promising approach toward an HIV-1 vaccine involves infecting people with cytomegalovirus engineered to express proteins from HIV-1. This approach, which works by eliciting virus-killing ... 
<b> [Astronomy] How stars grow</b>:  Conventional wisdom has long held that young stars grow gradually through the inward migration of mass within their protoplanetary disks. Liu  et al.  now show that the process ... 
<b> [Carbon Cycle] Warming making bigger CO2 swings</b>:   concentrations over the ... 
<b> [Gene Regulation] Parasitic DNAs help and hinder evolution</b>:  Transposable elements are parasitic DNAs that can duplicate themselves and jump around their host genomes. They can both disrupt gene function and drive genome evolution. Elbarbary ... 
<b> [Valleytronics] Stacking to prolong valley lifetime</b>:  , which, like graphene, has a two-dimensional honeycomb crystal lattice, the electronic structure has two “valleys.” Electrons can be distinguished by  ... 
<b> [Gene Regulation] Genetic programming for self-renewal</b>:  Instead of repopulating themselves from tissue-resident stem cell pools like most types of differentiated cells, tissue macrophages maintain themselves by self-renewing. The underlying ... 
<b> [Materials Science] Flexible power for flexible electronics</b>:  A challenge for flexible electronics is to couple devices with power sources that are also flexible. Ideally, they could also be processed in a way that is compatible with current microfabrication ... 
<b> [Microbial Physiology] Long-term partners uncoupled</b>:  Methane-munching archaea in marine sediments live closely coupled to sulfate-reducing bacteria in a syntrophic relationship. Surprisingly, however, these archaea do not necessarily ... 
<b> [Lung Physiology] Neuroendocrine cells as air sensors</b>:  Liters of air pass through the lung every minute. Signals in the atmospheric environment are processed into physiological outputs, including the immune response. Branchfield  et ... 
<b> [Epigenetics] Quantitative analysis of epigenetic memory</b>:  To explore quantitative and dynamic properties of transcriptional regulation by epigenetic modifications, Bintu  et al.  monitored a transcriptional reporter gene carried on ... 
<b> [Autoimmunity] T cells target peptide combos</b>:  One of the enduring mysteries of autoimmunity is the identity of the specific proteins targeted by autoimmune T cells. Delong  et al.  used mass spectrometry to elucidate the ... 
<b> [Biochemistry] Spatial control of cellular enzymes</b>:  Purine is a building block of DNA and also a component of ATP that is used as an energy source in the cell. Enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis organize into dynamic bodies called ... 
<b> [Evolution] Finding the organelles' ancestors</b>:  In contrast to bacteria and archaea, eukaryotic cells contain organelles called mitochondria that generate chemical energy; plant cells also contain plastids, the sites of photosynthesis. ... 
<b> [Allergy] Bringing atopic dermatitis up to scratch</b>:  Targeted therapies are transforming medicine, but complex diseases such as atopic dermatitis are difficult to target. Now, Jarrett et al. report a mechanism that links two contributors ... 
<b> [Plant Immunity] Improving plant disease responses</b>:  Disease resistance in plants depends on genes that allow them to recognize when they are infected by a pathogen so that they can mount a timely defense response. Unfortunately, pathogens ...

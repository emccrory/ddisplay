<b> [Cell Nucleus] Close-up view of the nuclear periphery</b>:  Cell biologists would like to be able to visualize complexes inside cells at molecular resolution. Several limitations, however, have prevented the field from realizing this goal. The ... 
<b> [Neuroimmunology] A T cell cause for autism?</b>:  The causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are complex and not entirely clear. Alterations in the mother's immune system during pregnancy, especially during key early periods of fetal ... 
<b> [Organic Lewis Acids] Silicon marries a chiral counterion</b>:  Acid is among the oldest and most versatile of chemical catalysts, but its symmetrical protons can't guide reactions to favor a product over its mirror image. Chemists have resolved ... 
<b> [Quantum Simulation] Watching fermions transition on site</b>:  Optical lattices are a promising platform for simulating the many-body physics that occurs in solids. In lattices filled with cold bosonic atoms, “quantum microscopy” makes it possible to  ... 
<b> [Thin Films] A golden opportunity for graphene</b>:  Reducing friction can limit wear and improve the energy efficiency of mechanical devices. Graphene is a promising lubricant because the friction between sheets is minuscule under certain ... 
<b> [Forest Ecology] Leaf seasonality in Amazon forests</b>:  Models assume that lower precipitation in tropical forests means less plant-available water and less photosynthesis. Direct measurements in the Amazon, however, show that production ... 
<b> [Cancer] Managing metastasis</b>:  Because of the poor prognosis of metastatic cancer, it is critical to determine exactly how various factors contribute to cancer spread. Mlecnik  et al.  examined the impact ... 
<b> [Cell Migration] Control cAMP to control migration</b>:  Activation of the G protein-coupled receptors that stimulate cellular migration generates active G protein α and βγ subunits. These subunits then interact with distinct effector mo ... 
<b> [Circadian Rhythms] Layered versatility atop circadian clocks</b>:  The circadian clock evolved to allow cells or organisms to anticipate changes in physiological requirements associated with Earth's 24-hour light/dark cycle. Some activities, however, ... 
<b> [Gene Editing] CRISPR-Cas captures invading RNA</b>:  The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) system provides bacteria with an adaptive immune response. DNA captured from viruses and plasmids by CRISPR-associated ... 
<b> [Organic Chemistry] Competition for binaphthyl catalysts</b>:  The binaphthyl framework has proven extremely effective in biasing a broad range of chemical reactions toward just one of two mirror-image products. The motif was first applied as a ... 
<b> [Water Infrastructure] Improving drinking water safety</b>:  In many countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, drinking water contains a residual disinfectant to guard against microbial contamination. Yet others, such as the ... 
<b> [Clinical Neuroscience] Treating Alzheimer's from the start</b>:  The formation of beta-amyloid plaques, known as Aβ aggregates, is implicated as a driving force of Alzheimer's disease. Vendruscolo  et al.  applied chemical kinetic approaches  ... 
<b> [Catalysis] Direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis</b>:  Hydrogen peroxide is synthesized industrially without direct contact of hydrogen and oxygen in order to achieve high concentrations. For many applications, only dilute aqueous solutions ... 
<b> [Conservation] Beyond utilitarian management</b>:  Efforts to conserve species and ecosystems tend to focus on their perceived social, cultural, and economic value to humans. In a Perspective, Sarrazin and Lecomte argue that these conservation ... 
<b> [Synaptic Vesicles] Neurotransmitter uptake one vesicle at a time</b>:  Despite opposing ionic gradients, synaptic vesicles are able to accumulate neurotransmitters. To resolve the mystery of how this happens, Farsi  et al.  made parallel measurements ... 
<b> [Meiosis] A partner protein for meiotic snip</b>:  Eukaryotes generate germ cells through meiotic recombination. This process initiates through breaks in genomic DNA catalyzed by the SPO11 protein. Vrielynck  et al.  and Robert ...

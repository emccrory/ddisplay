<b>Newswire: 9 September 2015 - CERN: One month to go until TEDxCERN "breaks the rules"</b>: Geneva, 9 September 2015. On Friday, 9 October, CERN will be hosting a TEDx conference for the third year running, this time on the theme of “Breaking the Rules”. Providing a platform for visionaries in fields such as science, novel technologies and education, the event, sponsored by Rolex, will take place on the CMS site in Cessy, France. Promoting “ideas worth spreading”, like all TEDx events, this conference will give a dozen speakers the chance to break the mould with the aim of improving our lives. They will propose innovative solutions for the future, taking into account today’s limitations.
<b>Newswire: 8 September 2015 - Kavli IPMU: Latest results from dark matter detector XMASS presented in Torino</b>: An experiment to test whether dark matter signals change throughout the year has found contradicting results to a previous experiment, announced an international team of researchers at the TAUP2015 conference in Italy this week. There is strong evidence that dark matter exists in our universe, but no one has ever detected it. Among many candidates, it is thought to be some sort of particle, with the best candidate to date being a WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle). Positive results have already been reported in the past by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment in Italy, which had found evidence a dark matter signal modulated with a period of one year.  
<b>Newswire: 7 September 2015 - InterAction Collaboration: Global Physics Photowalk 2015</b>: 07 September 2015 – Back by popular demand, eight of the world’s leading particle physics laboratories are joining together to host the Global Physics Photowalk on September 25-26, 2015.
Over 200 participants will have the rare opportunity to photograph state-of-the-art accelerators and detectors in all their beauty and complexity and to share them with the world through a global competition.
<b>Newswire: 1 September 2015 - CERN: ATLAS and CMS experiments shed light on Higgs properties</b>: Geneva/Saint PetersburgThree years after the announcement of the discovery of a new particle, the so-called Higgs boson, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations present for the first time combined measurements of many of its properties, at the third annual Large Hadron Collider Physics Conference (LHCP 2015). By combining their analyses of the data collected in 2011 and 2012, ATLAS and CMS draw the sharpest picture yet of this novel boson.

<b>Newswire: 26 August 2015 - SLAC: Antimatter catches a wave at SLAC</b>: Menlo Park, Calif. — A study led by researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the University of California, Los Angeles has demonstrated a new, efficient way to accelerate positrons, the antimatter opposites of electrons. The method may help boost the energy and shrink the size of future linear particle colliders – powerful accelerators that could be used to unravel the properties of nature’s fundamental building blocks.

<b>Newswire: 17 August 2015 - CERN: The ALICE experiment at CERN makes precise comparison of light nuclei and antinuclei</b>: Geneva, 17 August 2015. The ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN1 has made a precise measurement of the difference between ratios of the mass and electric charge of light nuclei and antinuclei. The result, published today in Nature Physics, (10.1038/nphys3432) a fundamental symmetry of nature to an unprecedented precision for light nuclei. The measurements are based on the ALICE experiments abilities to track and identify particles produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.
<b>Newswire: 17 August 2015 - FNAL: Dark Energy Survey finds more celestial neighbors</b>: Scientists on the Dark Energy Survey, using one of the world's most powerful digital cameras, have discovered eight more faint celestial objects hovering near our Milky Way galaxy. Signs indicate that they - like the objects found by the same team earlier this year - are likely dwarf satellite galaxies, the smallest and closest known form of galaxies.

		<title>Newswire: 13 April 2015 - Mapping the cosmos: Dark Energy Survey creates detailed guide to spotting dark matter</title>
					<description>Scientists on the Dark Energy Survey have released the first in a series of dark matter maps of the cosmos. These maps, created with one of the world's most powerful digital cameras, are the largest contiguous maps created at this level of detail and will improve our understanding of dark matter's role in the formation of galaxies. Analysis of the clumpiness of the dark matter in the maps will also allow scientists to probe the nature of the mysterious dark energy, believed to be causing the expansion of the universe to speed up.</description>

		<title>Newswire: 9 April 2015 -  Berkeley Lab and INFN: CUORE - Early results from an ultra-cold neutrino experiment</title>
					<description>An international team of scientists releases early results from the
CUORE experiment with implications for why there's more matter than
antimatter in the universe. Today an international team of nuclear physicists announced the first
scientific results from the Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare
Events (CUORE) experiment. CUORE, located at the INFN Gran Sasso National
Laboratories in Italy, is designed to confirm the existence of the
Majorana neutrino, which scientists believe could hold the key to why
there is an abundance of matter over antimatter. Or put another way: why
we exist in this universe.</description>

		<title>Newswire: 5 April 2015 - CERN: LHC restart update</title>
					<description>Geneva, 5 April 2015. After two years of intense maintenance and consolidation, and several months of preparation for restart, the Large Hadron Collider, the most powerful particle accelerator in the world, is back in operation. Today at 10.41am, a proton beam was back in the 27-kilometer ring, followed at 12.27pm by a second beam rotating in the opposite direction. These beams circulated at their injection energy of 450 GeV. Over the coming days, operators will check all systems before increasing energy of the beams.</description>

		<title>Newswire: 2 April 2015 - CERN: LHC restart update</title>
					<description>After a shutdown lasting two years, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world’s biggest and most powerful particle accelerator, is ready once again for the arrival of particle beams. The teams are completing the final tests after having solved on 31 March the problem that had been delaying the restart of the accelerator. The first beams could be circulating in the machine sometime between Saturday and Monday. “We are confident of being able to restart the machine over the weekend, as all of the tests performed so far have been successful,” said Frédérick Bordry, Director for Accelerators and Technology at CERN.</description>

<title>Newswire: 26 February 2015 - Media Advisory: Press briefing on the Large Hadron Collider re-start</title>
			<description>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is ready to start up for its second three-year run. The 27km LHC is the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world operating at a temperature of -217 degrees Centigrade and powered to a current of 11,000 amps. Run 2 of the LHC follows a two-year technical stop that prepared the machine for running at almost double the energy of the first run. After substantial the LHC will restart at an energy of 6.5 TeV per beam, which will open up a new window for discovery - collisions at a total energy of 13 TeV are expected late Spring. </description>

			<description>On January 31st, 2015, the Inaugural Symposium of the Hyper-Kamiokande Proto-Collaboration and Signing Ceremony was held at Kashiwa-no-ha Conference Center. The Hyper-Kamiokande project aims to address the mysteries of the origin and evolution of the Universe's matter and to confront theories of elementary particle unification. To realize these goals the project will combine a high intensity neutrino beam from the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) with a new detector based upon precision neutrino experimental techniques developed in Japan. The Hyper-Kamiokande project will be about 25 times larger than Super-Kamiokande, the research facility that was first to discover evidence for neutrino mass in 1998.

			<title>Newswire: 22 January 2015 - H.E.S.S. - An exceptionally powerful trio in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
			<description>Once again, the High Energy Stereoscopic System, H.E.S.S., has demonstrated its excellent capabilities. In the Large Magellanic Cloud, it discovered most luminous very high-energy gamma-ray sources: three objects of different type, namely the most powerful pulsar wind nebula, the most powerful supernova remnant, and a shell of 270 light years in diameter blown by multiple stars, and supernovae – a so-called superbubble. This is the first time that stellar-type gamma-ray sources are detected in an external galaxy, at these gamma-ray energies. The superbubble represents a new source class in very high-energy gamma rays.

			<title>Newswire: 12 December 2014 - CERN's Large Hadron Collider gears up for run 2 </title>
			<description>CERN announced today at the 174th session of the CERN Council that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is gearing up for its second three-year run. The LHC is the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world and the whole 27-kilometre superconducting machine is now almost cooled to its nominal operating temperature of 1.9 degrees above absolute zero. All teams are at work to get the LHC back online and the CERN Control Centre is in full swing to carry out all the requested tests before circulating proton beams again in March 2015. Run 2 of the LHC follows a 2-year technical stop that prepared the machine for running at almost double the energy of the LHC's first run.

			<title>Newswire: 10 December 2014 - INFN: ICARUS on the road</title>
			<description>Last night ICARUS, the world's largest liquid argon neutrino detector, left the Gran Sasso Laboratory of the Italian Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) and is now on its way to CERN (European Organisation for Nuclear Research) in Geneva. Since 2010, ICARUS T600 - that is its full name - has been observing the neutrino beam sent from CERN to the Gran Sasso underground laboratory passing through 730 km of the Earth's crust. Now ICARUS has been carefully loaded onto two special equipment transporters and is being transferred to CERN to be overhauled and upgraded, in view of its probable future use in the United States. Physicists believe it is an essential and as yet inimitable element for an experiment with low-energy neutrinos at Fermilab in Chicago. ICARUS is the only detector in the world with more than 600 tonnes of argon, and has been found to be entirely suitable. The technology of ICARUS, first proposed in 1977 by Carlo Rubbia, who is still the spokesperson of the experiment, is an example of record-breaking performance by Italian scientists at the INFN, who have developed a unique solution. The experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory has demonstrated its precision in detecting neutrinos artificially produced in an accelerator, such as those in the CNGS (CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso) beam, which ran from 2006 to 2012. The experiment is capable of combining the originality of the idea with technical precision and efficiency.

			<title>Newswire: 8 December 2014 - Berkeley Lab: World record for compact particle accelerator</title>
			<description>Using one of the most powerful lasers in the world, researchers have accelerated subatomic particles to the highest energies ever recorded from a compact accelerator.

The team, from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (Berkeley Lab), used a specialized petawatt laser and a charged-particle gas called plasma to get the particles up to speed. The setup is known as a laser-plasma accelerator, an emerging class of particle accelerators that physicists believe can shrink traditional, miles-long accelerators to machines that can fit on a table.

The researchers sped up the particles—electrons in this case—inside a nine-centimeter long tube of plasma. The speed corresponded to an energy of 4.25 giga-electron volts. The acceleration over such a short distance corresponds to an energy gradient 1000 times greater than traditional particle accelerators and marks a world record energy for laser-plasma accelerators.

			<title>Newswire: 4 December 2014 - CNRS, CEA and CNES - Planck: new revelations on dark matter and relic neutrinos</title>
			<description>The Planck collaboration, which notably includes the CNRS, CEA, CNES and several French universities, has disclosed, at a conference in Ferrara, Italy, the results of four years of observations from the ESA's Planck satellite. The satellite aims to study relic radiation (the most ancient light in the Universe). This light has been measured precisely across the entire sky for the first time, in both intensity and polarisation, thereby producing the oldest image of the Universe. This primordial light lets us "see" some of the most elusive particles in the Universe: dark matter and relic neutrinos.

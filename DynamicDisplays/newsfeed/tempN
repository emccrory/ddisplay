She represents the Forum on Physics and Society on the Council.</p>
<p>The 32-member <a href="http://www.aps.org/about/governance/leadership/council/index.cfm">APS Council of Representatives</a> focuses on all matters of APS science and membership, including science policy.  Responsibilities of the council include establishment and oversight of APS publications, approval of policy statements and strategy, and admission of members and election of fellows, among others.</p>
<p>Bhat previously served as the chair of the APS Forum on Physics and Society, which has about 6,000 members, and on the APS Governance Committee. As a member of the APS Council of Representatives, Bhat will work to ensure that the associated Forum on Physics and Society continues to be a major contributor to the discussions and actions of the council on issues pertaining to science and society, to the scientific strategy of the APS, and science policy that affects science funding and the future of our society.   </p>
<p>Bhat is currently deputy head of Fermilab Program Planning and an adjunct professor and graduate faculty at Northern Illinois University.  She is also a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Since joining Fermilab in 1989, Bhat has led numerous projects.  She is an active member of the CMS collaboration at CERN and contributed to the Higgs boson discovery and the study of its properties. She is a co-author of numerous peer-reviewed publications, has given many invited talks and public lectures, and has organized several international conferences and workshops.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, staff who work in the Chief Operating Officer organization gathered in Ramsey Auditorium for our periodic “what’s happening at the lab” meeting. Over a whirlwind 60 minutes we covered the lab’s priorities and the great work happening across our organization. Since I gave the guest speakers a limit of five slides and 60 seconds each to present them, here are my five “top takeaways,&#8221; each presented in less than 60 seconds or 100 words.</p>
<ol>
<li>The President released his FY2017 budget request to Congress on Feb. 9. While this is a request and not the lab’s final funding, it certainly sets a positive tone. In the second year of executing the P5 plan, <strong>the Office of Science High Energy Physics and Fermilab continue to be well supported</strong>. In fact, the requested HEP funding compared to last year’s request is the third-highest percentage increase in the Office of Science. And the request for Fermilab project funding is up 9.5 percent over last year, thanks to the great progress demonstrated by LBNF/DUNE.</li>
<li>As Nigel stated in his Feb. 1 all-hands message, “…Fermilab must tap into more and more diverse communities to find the best people to join our team.” While we are in the early days of analysis and data examination, <strong>it’s clear that we fail to select diverse candidates despite, in some cases, having diverse applicant pools.</strong> So we (and we means everyone at the lab) need to figure out how to improve. With WDRS, we’re looking at new and better ways to recruit and retain, leverage our outreach and education programs, and further the diversity and inclusion conversation.</li>
<li>What is a patent? Aaron Sauers from the Office of Partnerships and Technology Transfer explained that a patent is similar to a publication and that it teaches others about your invention. <strong>A patent ensures that your great idea is available for future generations </strong>and makes certain that you are credited for that idea. If you happen to see Aaron and would like more information about the importance of patents, ask him to tell you the story about Richard Feynman and nuclear power!</li>
<li>The Facilities Engineering Services Section<strong> is busy modernizing the lab’s infrastructure in preparation for the next 50 years.</strong> The Integrated Engineering Research Center continues to progress, with a CD-1 review planned for this fall. With $9 million in Science Laboratory Infrastructure funding, Wilson Hall renovation work will begin this summer, starting with the 13th floor. Replacement of the Master Substation is under way, and the industrial cooling water work is progressing well. Many other projects throughout the site continue to keep our FESS team on the go.</li>
<li>And last but certainly not least,<strong> Nigel’s recipe for success at Fermilab is “everything must shine and everything must align.”</strong> This means that all projects must stay on schedule and within budget, we must continue to deliver top quality science, excellent operations and administration are necessities, we must stay focused on safety, and we must foster a diverse workforce. It also means that we all must align with the lab priorities and strategy; DOE, the Office of Science, OHEP and Fermilab must stay aligned; the Fermilab senior team must keep alignment; and Fermilab and CERN must remain aligned.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s the quick version. If you’d like a copy of the full presentation, please contact <a href="mailto:debseb@fnal.gov">Deb Sebastian</a> in the Office of Communication.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[Greg Gilbert manages the Operations and Maintenance (O&#038;M) Department in Facility Engineering Services/Facilities Maintenance.]]></description>
                          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_33537" style="width: 165px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://news.fnal.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/greg_gilbert.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-33537" src="http://news.fnal.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/greg_gilbert.jpg" alt="Greg Gilbert" width="155" height="167" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Greg Gilbert</p></div>
<p>The current ESH&amp;Q Joule is <strong>Greg Gilbert</strong>.</p>
<p>Greg Gilbert manages the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Department in Facility Engineering Services/Facilities Maintenance.</p>
<p>His principal responsibility is the managerial and technical oversight of field inspections and work activities performed by O&amp;M mechanical, electrical, HVAC crafts and contractors. The O&amp;M group provides utility systems surveillance, operations, maintenance and repairs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year on a 6,800-acre site with a $1.8 billion total replacement plant value, 355 buildings with 2.4 million gross square feet, 69 trailers with 81,000 gross square feet, two primary substations, 241 secondary substations, 115 miles of electric cable, 27 miles of industrial cooling water piping, 19 miles of domestic water piping, 14 miles of sanitary pipe, 16 ponds and 18 miles of natural gas pipe. O&amp;M manages, maintains and repairs Fermilab’s electrical distribution, industrial cooling water (ICW), surface water, Central Utility Building heating, cooling, LCW systems and regeneration, natural gas, sanitary sewer, HVAC, lighting, domestic water, ground water sump pumping and related systems.</p>
<p>O&amp;M’s mission is to provide a stable base for experimental operations and to ensure the dependability of Fermilab’s infrastructure through core maintenance in a safe, reliable and efficient manner.</p>
<p>Greg also fulfills responsibilities as liaison between O&amp;M and accelerator operations and for projects such as the Utility Upgrade Piping improvement Project, currently in progress.</p>
<p>“Having been at the lab for a while, I’ve seen safety initiatives come and go,&#8221; Greg said. &#8220;The two that have made the most impact in our group were integrated safety management, which delegated safety to line management, and human performance improvement, which was both a safety and a managerial cultural change. We rely on HPI!”</p>

                          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microwaves are accelerating cooking appliance, and so it makes sense that we’d have them at Fermilab (as well as in every home and business across the US).</p>
<p>Two recent incidents at Fermilab have highlighted problems associated with microwaving paper cups. Heating – or reheating &#8211; coffee or tea in a paper cups seems less of a problem, than heating a nearly empty paper cup or dry food, such as oatmeal. Like all paper products, paper cups are derived from organic cellulose material, held together by the seams with adhesive. These products are combustible. In fact, the manufacturer of the paper cups available at the Fermilab stockroom, provides a warning that the paper cups are NOT microwavable. Unfortunately, this warning is only on the bulk package that the cups are shipped in and not marked on the individual cups.</p>
<p>Please use caution when microwaving items made of paper. Soon you will see postings warning that paper cups are not microwavable.</p>

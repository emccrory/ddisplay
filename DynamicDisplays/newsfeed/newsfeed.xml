<![CDATA[<p>
Fermilab retiree Chuck Andrle passed away January 7, 2016, in Lombard. Chuck retired from the Fermilab Computing Division in 1996 after 27 years of service as the Manager of the Instrument Repair Department closely associated with PREP (Physics Research Equipment Pool). Prior to working at Fermilab, Chuck was employed at Argonne National Laboratory.</p>

<p>
At Fermilab, he supervised and mentored dozens of electronic technicians that supported high-energy physics (HEP) equipment used in Fixed-Target experiments and test beams. Chuck was a founding member of the Association for Research Electronic Pools, otherwise known as AFREP, an organization consisting of representatives of electronic equipment pools within the HEP laboratories worldwide.</p>

<p>
He is remembered as an employee who had a great sense of humor, thoroughly enjoyed his work, and enthusiastically helped colleagues and the Physics program. See Adams, Winterfield &amp; Sullivan Funeral Home for arrangements: <a href="http://www.adamswinterfieldsullivan.com/">

<p class="wp-caption-text">
In LHC collisions, scientists observe events in which a lepton matter-antimatter pair is produced. These leptons are produced back to back, and scientists measure the fraction of times that the lepton is produced on the pink side. This allows researchers to make precise measurements of the electroweak force. These measurements are very sensitive to seeing new physics.</p>
</div>

<p>
Scientists use LHC data to make many measurements. Some of them are serious discoveries. Some are careful measurements of things we already know about taken at higher energies to verify that our theory still works. And a few of them are super-precise measurements that straddle the two. This means that a precisely known variable is measured with equal precision to see if the prediction and measurement agree. If they don’t, we could be on to something.</p>

<p>
One such measurement is when an electron-antielectron pair or, equivalently, a muon-antimuon pair is created from a particle collision. These two particles are of the class of particles called leptons. This process is unusual. Normally when two protons collide in the LHC, either the quarks or gluons that make up the protons interact via the strong force.</p>

<p>
However, very rarely, a quark from one proton will interact with an antimatter quark from the other proton via either the electromagnetic force or weak force. In fact, one of the achievements in theoretical physics that led to the Higgs boson discovery was the demonstration that the weak and electromagnetic forces were two components of a single force, called the electroweak force.</p>

<p>
When quark-antiquark pairs interact via the electroweak force, they make a particle that is a mix of the photon and the Z boson that is governed by the rules of quantum mechanics. Because of the quantum mechanical mix, the newly created particle has properties of both the photon and Z boson.</p>

<img class="size-medium wp-image-33966" src="http://news.fnal.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CMSResult160226_Analyzers01-300x234.jpg" alt="These physicists contributed to this analysis." width="300" height="234" srcset="http://news.fnal.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CMSResult160226_Analyzers01-300x234.jpg 300w, http://news.fnal.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CMSResult160226_Analyzers01-768x600.jpg 768w, http://news.fnal.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CMSResult160226_Analyzers01-1024x800.jpg 1024w, http://news.fnal.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CMSResult160226_Analyzers01-250x195.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />
</a>
<p class="wp-caption-text">
These physicists contributed to this analysis.</p>
</div>

<p>
Electroweak theory makes very precise predictions of the angle between the colliding quark direction (which is in the same direction as the LHC beams) and the direction that the postcollision lepton is scattered. This angle could be at 90 degrees with respect to the beam, or the angle could be very small, meaning that the lepton is produced near the beam, either nearly parallel to the quark or antiquark. By calculating the ratio of how often the lepton is on the quark side versus the antiquark side, scientists can precisely probe electroweak theory.</p>

<p>
If the data disagrees with the prediction, it would mean that new and unanticipated particles were being made. This measurement is a very sensitive way to search for new physics. Unfortunately, the measurement showed no indication of new physics but, on a positive note, the measurement was an impressive endorsement of electroweak theory.</p>

<p>
This <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/2125470/files/arXiv:1601.04768.pdf">
measurement</a>
 used LHC data recorded during 2012 at a collision energy of 8 trillion electronvolts (TeV). Since 2015, the LHC has been recording data at a collision energy of 13 TeV, which is 60 percent higher than before. This analysis is being repeated at the higher energy, and we hope the higher energy will reveal something new.</p>

Knowing the probability that an electron neutrino interacts with protons and neutrons is necessary for measuring charge-parity (CP) violation with high precision.</p>
</div>

<p>
Neutrinos have provided us with many surprises and puzzles in the history of particle physics, as physicists at Fermilab and around the world have studied them with a variety of beams and detectors. Of all known particles with any mass at all, they are by far the lightest. They interact so weakly that as many neutrinos from the sun pass through us at night as during the day. They also come in three distinct flavors and can oscillate from one flavor to the others.</p>

<p>
Important questions about the nature of neutrinos remain. What are the masses for the different types of neutrinos? Are the neutrino and antineutrino the same particle? Are there actually more than three different types of neutrinos? Do neutrinos behave fundamentally differently than antineutrinos in their flavor oscillations?</p>

<p>
A difference in the oscillation of neutrinos and antineutrinos, beyond that expected from the fact that our beams pass through an Earth made of matter and not antimatter, would be a violation of charge-parity (CP) symmetry. An observation of CP violation in neutrinos could be key to explaining the near-total absence of antimatter in the universe.</p>

<p>
To solve the puzzle, physicists can compare the electron neutrino and electron antineutrino appearance rate in a detector hundreds of kilometers away from a neutrino beam source of muon neutrinos and muon antineutrinos. In these studies, physicists need to know to high precision the total probability of an electron neutrino interacting with the protons and neutrons in the detector.</p>

</div>

<p>
Friday’s Wine and Cheese Seminar at Fermilab features the first cross section measurement from the NOvA collaboration: We present the measurement of the total probability that an electron neutrino interacts with the protons and neutrons inside the NOvA near detector. There are very few of this kind of measurement in the world, and this NOvA measurement presents the largest data set in the electron neutrino energy region from 1 GeV to 3 GeV. This energy region is particularly important for future long-baseline neutrino experiments, such as DUNE.</p>

<p>
This measurement is a challenge as electron neutrinos account for only about 1 percent of the total neutrinos in the NuMI unoscillated beam. Fortunately, thanks to the superb granularity and energy resolution of the NOvA near detector, the rate of the misidentification of electron neutrinos is well under control.</p>

<p>
The results indicate that the probability of an electron neutrino interacting with protons and neutrons is greater than the previous prediction from commonly used model. They will also allow for the tuning of theoretical models for this process, which is of great relevance for improving the sensitivity of electron neutrino appearance measurement in future long-baseline neutrino experiments.</p>

<p>
Ten new members joined Fermilab’s Community Advisory Board in 2015, bringing with them fresh insight on lab activities and projects for the new year.</p>

<p>
The advisory board was established in fall 2009 following the success of two community task forces. It meets once every two months. The main mission of the board is to provide ongoing advice and guidance related to the future of the laboratory.</p>

<p>
“I’ve always been drawn to Fermilab, and I have a great love for physics,” said Alex Tsang, chief forensic psychologist at the Kane County Diagnostic Center and new board member. “As a group, we’re reflective of the community and offer different perspectives from our various professions.”</p>

<p>
The laboratory’s goal in selecting board members is to assemble a group that represents the diverse community surrounding the lab. Potential members from neighboring communities are invited to apply to participate on the board. The 2016 board has 27 members with professional experience in areas such as business, medicine and civil service.</p>

<p>
“I was always fascinated by Fermilab, but I didn’t know a lot about what it did,” said James Gebhardt, vice president of finance and human resources at the Spectrios Institute for Low Vision and Community Advisory Board member since 2009. “I did a little research before I applied for the committee, and I saw they wanted a cross section of people with different expertise. I thought maybe my background could bring some benefit to their discussions.”</p>

<p>
At recent meetings, members have discussed the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility and Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, Fermilab’s planned flagship facility and experiment. They have provided community feedback on the Fermilab Campus Master Plan, a major initiative that aims to create greater scientific access to the lab and build world-class facilities. These projects will bring major changes to the campus layout, and the board provides input on laboratory construction and progress.</p>

<p>
Another point of interest for the board members is international cooperation at Fermilab.</p>

<p>
“Before joining the board, I never realized the grand reach that Fermilab has,” Tsang said. “The diversity of minds, backgrounds, educational experiences and cultures can only benefit and enhance what the lab is already doing. It’s an honor to be a part of this.”</p>

<p>
As the lab continues to grow, public feedback becomes critical. Community Advisory Board meetings are open to the public, and updates on board activities are available on www.fermilabcommunity.org.</p>

<p>
“Fermilab takes our input seriously,” Gebhardt said. “We’re not a ‘no-name’ group, and it’s encouraging that the lab has this valuable dialogue with the community.”</p>

</div>

<p>
The DZero collaboration at Fermilab on Thursday announced the discovery of a <a href="http://www-d0.fnal.gov/Run2Physics/WWW/results/final/B/B16A/">
new particle</a>
 whose quark content appears to be qualitatively different from normal.</p>

<p>
An ordinary meson is composed of a quark and an antiquark, whereas an ordinary baryon is made from three quarks. Physicists have long conjectured that exotic particles containing an additional quark-antiquark pair could exist, and a handful of candidates have been seen. Such particles, called tetraquarks, or their close relatives, the pentaquarks, would be exotic states forming a new particle species paralleling the ordinary mesons and baryons.</p>

<p>
DZero searched for new exotic states decaying into a B<sub>
s</sub>
 meson and a pi meson. Both of these are well-known mesons, which travel finite distances before decaying via the weak nuclear interaction. The B<sub>
s</sub>
 meson is composed of a quark and an antiquark of bottom and strange types, and the pi meson has an up and down quark and antiquark.</p>

<p>
The study, using the full data set acquired at the Tevatron collider from 2002 to 2011 totaling 10 inverse femtobarns, identified the B<sub>
s</sub>
 meson through its decay into intermediate J/psi and phi mesons, which subsequently decayed into a pair of oppositely charged muons and a pair of oppositely charged K mesons respectively (see diagram).</p>

</div>

<p>
The plot of the mass distribution of the B<sub>
s</sub>
 and pi meson combination (see the mass plot) shows an excess of 133 ± 31 events over the estimated background, with a mass of 5,568 MeV. The mass peak of the new state, called X(5568), is relatively broad (22 MeV) indicating that the particle decays via the strong interaction. The probability that previously known processes could have fluctuated to give a signal as strong as that seen is only 1 in about 6 million (5.1 standard deviation significance), after taking into account the estimated uncertainties in the analysis and the possibility that such a fluctuation could have occurred anywhere within the search window.</p>

<p>
The fact that the new X(5568) particle decays via the strong interaction into a B<sub>
s</sub>
 and pi mesons tells us that it contains four distinct flavors of quarks and antiquarks – bottom, strange, up and down. Several other previously observed particles are good candidates to be tetraquark or pentaquark states, but all of these have a quark and antiquark of the same flavor, and thus their character as an exotic particle is less certain.</p>

</div>

<p>
The detailed internal structure of the new X(5568) particle, or the other tetraquark candidates, is not yet understood; they could be a relatively tightly bound combination of all four quarks and antiquarks, or they could be a structures in which two tightly bound quark-antiquark states revolve around each other (see figure).</p>

<p>
Measuring the properties of the new X(5568) particle and other tetraquark candidates – their masses, lifetimes, spins and parities, as well as the probabilities for them to decay into various final particle combinations – will give valuable new information about how the strong force binds quarks (and antiquarks) into observable particles.</p>

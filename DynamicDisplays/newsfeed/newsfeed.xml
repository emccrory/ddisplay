<strong>
How long have you been at Fermilab?</strong>
<br />

It has been three years since this past Saturday, Feb. 13.</p>

<p>
<strong>
What brought you to Fermilab?</strong>
<br />

Before Fermilab, I was unfortunately laid off from a university as a college recruiter. My mom saw a job posting at Fermilab and kept saying, “You have to apply!” I had no idea what Fermilab was, but I applied anyway. While I was laid off, I kept a part-time job. I told my coworkers at the part-time job about my interview with the lab, and they were ecstatic. Once I completed my interview, I could understand why everyone was so excited.</p>

<p>
<strong>
What do you do at Fermilab?</strong>
<br />

I help fill most of the positions at the lab. There are three recruiters. Chong Shik Park typically fills all the scientific postings. Chris Raymond and I are tasked with filling every other job, such as executive-level positions, engineering jobs, project manager jobs and IT positions.</p>

<p>
<strong>
What does your typical day look like?</strong>
<br />

Depending on the priority, our tasks change daily. At the end of the day, our goal is to hire new employees. I am the first contact with prospective candidates, and I shepherd them through the interview process. I screen hundreds of resumes, talk to hiring managers to understand the scope of the job and widely distribute job postings to organizations, universities and Web vendors to reach a diverse applicant pool. It takes a lot of interaction, and you have to be a people person to be in talent acquisition.</p>

<p>
<strong>
What do you enjoy doing outside of work?</strong>
<br />

I am a mother of a two-year-old. Most of my old hobbies have been put on the back burner. I love to travel, and I’m active in my Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and teaching children’s church, but lately I spend a lot of time at Chuck E. Cheese’s. My newfound love is the gym, and I take Zumba classes at our lab gym. I also love to swim, and I recently enrolled my daughter in Mommy &amp; Me swimming classes to share that love with her.</p>

<p>
<strong>
What’s some advice you would give to a new hire?</strong>
<br />

Be receptive to embracing change. One thing that prepared me for the lab environment when I first started was to take every single tour and meet people to learn all I could about the work they perform for the lab. It’s important to work really hard, but it’s also important to enjoy your work. I tell people to take advantage of the lab’s recreational and cultural resources. There’s something here to do for everyone.</p>

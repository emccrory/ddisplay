TRISEP 2016 Summer School in Subatomic Particle Physics</p>

<p>
Dear colleagues,</p>

<p>
We draw your attention to TRISEP 2016, a summer school for graduate students in subatomic particle physics. The school has been held annually since 2013 and is organized in collaboration between the Perimeter Institute, SNOLab and TRIUMF.

<p>
Standard Model and beyond<br />

Neutrino physics<br />

Higgs physics<br />

Dark matter<br />

Techniques for particle colliders<br />

Particle detection methods</p>

<p>
These topics will be presented by world experts in the respective fields, including:</p>

<p>
Nathaniel Craig (UC Santa Barbara)<br />

Glen Cowan (Royal Holloway)<br />

<p>
Are you about to create a new presentation, send a memo, write a project note, assemble a meeting agenda or design a poster for a conference? Have you been thinking of updating your email signature or wondering if you’re using the latest lab letterhead?</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/faw/designstandards/index.html">
Fermilab Graphics Standards</a>
 website is your one-stop shop for lab-branded document and presentation templates, Fermilab logos, email signatures, and design guidelines including colors and fonts.</p>

<p>
As of last week, the suite of <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/faw/designstandards/templates/index.html">
templates</a>
 available on the Graphics Standards site now includes project/experiment notes, visit/meeting agendas, MOUs, scientific posters and fact sheets in addition to updated PowerPoint and Keynote presentations, letterheads and memos. Most templates are available in several versions.</p>

<p>
You’re all familiar with the physical infrastructure modernization that has brought so many needed upgrades and changes to the lab site. In parallel with our physical renovation, the Office of Communication has been renovating the look and feel of our communication products — ensuring that the face we present to the world through our communications matches a modern, international and innovative lab at the forefront of science and technology.</p>

<p>
Over the last two years the Office of Communication has worked to develop a modern, consistent look and feel for many of our communication products. Our public websites, presentation and document templates, business cards, brochures, exhibits, and even our email signatures have all received a makeover — and will continue to be improved and upgraded in the years to come.</p>

<p>
But our work is by no means finished. We need your help to continue to improve our communications to our colleagues, the scientific community and the public. We’re looking for feedback on existing templates and ideas for new ones. Please contact the <a href="mailto:creativeservices@fnal.gov">
Creative Services department</a>
 and let us know what you think, and what you need.</p>

<p>

<p>
President Obama’s Science Advisor John Holdren and the leaders of three key federal agencies spoke at a symposium at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington D.C., in February on “Grand Visions for the Future of U.S. Science in a New Global Era.” As a member of the Physics and Societal Impacts of Science &amp; Engineering Sections of the AAAS, I organized and moderated the session.</p>

<p>
Holdren, who presented the view from the White House, said that science, technology and innovation (known as ST&amp;I) are central to meeting key challenges of economic growth, health care, clean energy and national security, as well as to &#8220;lifting the human spirit through discovery, invention and expanded understanding.&#8221; He emphasized that the Obama administration has taken the advice of the ST&amp;I community to an extraordinary degree, subject to constraints of budget. He outlined a number of ST&amp;I priorities and initiatives under President Obama and argued that, with his vision for science, the President has also charted a practical path and walked the walk.</p>

<p>
NSF Director France Córdova talked about the research program at all scales of science that the NSF supports — the smallest scales studied through experimental particle physics to the cosmic scales in astronomy and astrophysics. She also talked about some new cross-agency initiatives, about global STEM education and increasing international partnerships. Undersecretary for Science and Energy Lynn Orr emphasized that fundamental scientific research is essential to our energy future, and that the Department of Energy funds scientific research through 10 national labs and three applied energy research labs. He talked about the neutrino science research at Fermilab and other basic science areas as well as exascale computing and its potential in simulations of complex systems and processes. Administrator Bolden, head of NASA, made remarks on NASA&#8217;s ambitious program to send American astronauts to Mars in the 2030s and to asteroids before then, how NASA&#8217;s satellites are studying our own planet, and on studies on the International Space Station. He said that the future of NASA is strong. It is helping us to uncover the secrets of the universe and to create the future, and as President Obama said, “We are pushing farther into the solar system, not just to visit, but to stay.”</p>

<p>
A panel discussion on globalization, international partnerships and public outreach, as well as a Q&amp;A with the audience, followed.</p>

Fermilab is in the midst of extensive growth and development to expand physics programs, and to upgrade aging infrastructure to ensure many more decades of continued research. Five construction projects are currently under way that involve excavating and transporting soil and gravel.  Construction crews monitor and clean the roads as necessary, but mud and loose gravel can accumulate, posing a slip and fall hazard.  Motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians are reminded to use extra caution when traveling on roads that are used for construction activities.</p>

<p>
By working together, we can keep everyone safe while Fermilab reinforces its reputation as America’s premier particle physics laboratory.</p>

<p>
During this winter’s session of the U.S. Particle Accelerator School hosted by the University of Texas at Austin, we awarded the first “Iron Man” service recognitions to the two faculty members who have taught the most USPAS courses over the more than 50 university-style sessions since 1987.</p>

<p>
The two awardees, Don Cossairt (ESH&amp;Q) and Mike Syphers (NIU/Fermilab) have made indispensable contributions to training the present and future scientists and technologists who are essential to the vitality of the accelerators of the DOE Office of Science.</p>

<p>
For the 13th time, Don has taught the course “Radiation Physics, Regulation and Management” to students ranging from accelerator physicists to engineers to radiation protection professionals. In addition to carrying the usual academic credit associated with USPAS courses, Don’s classes also carry continuing education credit from the American Academy of Health Physics. Such credit is essential for health physics professionals to maintain their professional certification. To bolster his classroom presentations, Don has written an impressive set of course materials (available as Fermilab TM-1834 “Radiation Physics for Personnel and Environmental Protection”) and has mentored many co-instructors.</p>

<p>
We honored our most frequent lecturer, Mike Syphers, for teaching a record 15 times. Mike is rightly proud that, since 1988, he has taught more than 500 USPAS students. Many accelerator scientists and engineers credit Mike with helping them decide on a career in our field. With Don Edwards, Mike also co-authored the textbook “An Introduction to the Physics of High Energy Accelerators,&#8221; a mainstay in the field and the most-often used textbook at the USPAS. Don and Mike were both honored “in recognition and appreciation of exceptional contributions in teaching at USPAS sessions.&#8221;</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
Yesterday morning, staff who work in the Chief Operating Officer organization gathered in Ramsey Auditorium for our periodic “what’s happening at the lab” meeting. Over a whirlwind 60 minutes we covered the lab’s priorities and the great work happening across our organization. Since I gave the guest speakers a limit of five slides and 60 seconds each to present them, here are my five “top takeaways,&#8221; each presented in less than 60 seconds or 100 words.</p>

<ol>

<li>
The President released his FY2017 budget request to Congress on Feb. 9. While this is a request and not the lab’s final funding, it certainly sets a positive tone. In the second year of executing the P5 plan, <strong>
the Office of Science High Energy Physics and Fermilab continue to be well supported</strong>
. In fact, the requested HEP funding compared to last year’s request is the third-highest percentage increase in the Office of Science. And the request for Fermilab project funding is up 9.5 percent over last year, thanks to the great progress demonstrated by LBNF/DUNE.</li>

<li>
As Nigel stated in his Feb. 1 all-hands message, “…Fermilab must tap into more and more diverse communities to find the best people to join our team.” While we are in the early days of analysis and data examination, <strong>
it’s clear that we fail to select diverse candidates despite, in some cases, having diverse applicant pools.</strong>
 So we (and we means everyone at the lab) need to figure out how to improve. With WDRS, we’re looking at new and better ways to recruit and retain, leverage our outreach and education programs, and further the diversity and inclusion conversation.</li>

<li>
What is a patent? Aaron Sauers from the Office of Partnerships and Technology Transfer explained that a patent is similar to a publication and that it teaches others about your invention. <strong>
A patent ensures that your great idea is available for future generations </strong>
and makes certain that you are credited for that idea. If you happen to see Aaron and would like more information about the importance of patents, ask him to tell you the story about Richard Feynman and nuclear power!</li>

<li>
The Facilities Engineering Services Section<strong>
 is busy modernizing the lab’s infrastructure in preparation for the next 50 years.</strong>
 The Integrated Engineering Research Center continues to progress, with a CD-1 review planned for this fall. With $9 million in Science Laboratory Infrastructure funding, Wilson Hall renovation work will begin this summer, starting with the 13th floor. Replacement of the Master Substation is under way, and the industrial cooling water work is progressing well. Many other projects throughout the site continue to keep our FESS team on the go.</li>

<li>
And last but certainly not least,<strong>
 Nigel’s recipe for success at Fermilab is “everything must shine and everything must align.”</strong>
 This means that all projects must stay on schedule and within budget, we must continue to deliver top quality science, excellent operations and administration are necessities, we must stay focused on safety, and we must foster a diverse workforce. It also means that we all must align with the lab priorities and strategy; DOE, the Office of Science, OHEP and Fermilab must stay aligned; the Fermilab senior team must keep alignment; and Fermilab and CERN must remain aligned.</li>

</ol>

<p>
That’s the quick version. If you’d like a copy of the full presentation, please contact <a href="mailto:debseb@fnal.gov">
Deb Sebastian</a>
 in the Office of Communication.</p>

<p>
The current ESH&amp;Q Joule is <strong>
Greg Gilbert</strong>
.</p>

<p>
Greg Gilbert manages the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Department in Facility Engineering Services/Facilities Maintenance.</p>

<p>
His principal responsibility is the managerial and technical oversight of field inspections and work activities performed by O&amp;M mechanical, electrical, HVAC crafts and contractors. The O&amp;M group provides utility systems surveillance, operations, maintenance and repairs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year on a 6,800-acre site with a $1.8 billion total replacement plant value, 355 buildings with 2.4 million gross square feet, 69 trailers with 81,000 gross square feet, two primary substations, 241 secondary substations, 115 miles of electric cable, 27 miles of industrial cooling water piping, 19 miles of domestic water piping, 14 miles of sanitary pipe, 16 ponds and 18 miles of natural gas pipe. O&amp;M manages, maintains and repairs Fermilab’s electrical distribution, industrial cooling water (ICW), surface water, Central Utility Building heating, cooling, LCW systems and regeneration, natural gas, sanitary sewer, HVAC, lighting, domestic water, ground water sump pumping and related systems.</p>

<p>
O&amp;M’s mission is to provide a stable base for experimental operations and to ensure the dependability of Fermilab’s infrastructure through core maintenance in a safe, reliable and efficient manner.</p>

<p>
Greg also fulfills responsibilities as liaison between O&amp;M and accelerator operations and for projects such as the Utility Upgrade Piping improvement Project, currently in progress.</p>

<p>
“Having been at the lab for a while, I’ve seen safety initiatives come and go,&#8221; Greg said. &#8220;The two that have made the most impact in our group were integrated safety management, which delegated safety to line management, and human performance improvement, which was both a safety and a managerial cultural change. We rely on HPI!”</p>

<![CDATA[Avoid placing paper cups in the microwave.]]>

<![CDATA[<p>
Microwaves are accelerating cooking appliance, and so it makes sense that we’d have them at Fermilab (as well as in every home and business across the US).</p>

<p>
Two recent incidents at Fermilab have highlighted problems associated with microwaving paper cups. Heating – or reheating &#8211; coffee or tea in a paper cups seems less of a problem, than heating a nearly empty paper cup or dry food, such as oatmeal. Like all paper products, paper cups are derived from organic cellulose material, held together by the seams with adhesive. These products are combustible. In fact, the manufacturer of the paper cups available at the Fermilab stockroom, provides a warning that the paper cups are NOT microwavable. Unfortunately, this warning is only on the bulk package that the cups are shipped in and not marked on the individual cups.</p>

<p>
Please use caution when microwaving items made of paper. Soon you will see postings warning that paper cups are not microwavable.</p>

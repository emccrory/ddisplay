<![CDATA[<p>
Fermilab recognizes that supporting employees in their efforts to balance career and family life remains a crucial benefit. To help support that balance, a new Fermilab <a href="http://wdrs.fnal.gov/benefits/parental-leave.html">
parental leave policy</a>
 is available beginning today, March 1, and a tax-free commuter benefit program that will begin on June 1.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>
Parental leave policy</em>
</strong>
</p>

<p>
Following a birth or adoption, the new policy provides six weeks of paid time off for the eligible primary caregiver and one week of paid time off for the eligible secondary caregiver. The parental leave policy offers flexibility with a variety of time off and return to work schedules, based on what works for you and your supervisor.</p>

<p>
To ensure you receive the full benefits that you are allowed, remember to notify your <a href="https://wdrs.fnal.gov/section/hrpartner.html">
HR partner</a>
 at least 30 days prior to births or adoptions. Please contact the <a href="mailto:benefitsoffice@fnal.gov">
Benefits department</a>
 if you have any questions or would like additional information on the new policy.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>
Tax-free commuter benefit program</em>
</strong>
</p>

<p>
A tax-free commuter benefit program is available for employees who commute to work by bus, train or vanpool. To begin receiving benefits in June, you will need to contact the <a href="mailto:benefitsoffice@fnal.gov">
Benefits department</a>
 by March 21 to start the enrollment process. Once the Benefits department has enrolled you in the program via Payflex, you can pay both your transit fares and fees to park at the train or bus station with pre-tax dollars to help save on commuting costs. Employees may join the program monthly by contacting the <a href="mailto:benefitsoffice@fnal.gov">
Benefits department</a>

Careers in Data Science and Data Engineering Kathy Copic, Director of Growth at Insight Data Science Wednesday, March 9, at 1 p.m. in One West.</p>

<p>
Data science teams in industry analyze some of the most interesting data ever collected, in fields like health care, education, media, entertainment, transportation, and more. Scientists and engineers from high-energy physics and other quantitative fields are playing key roles in transforming the way companies work with data to impact our daily lives.</p>

<p>
Copic will discuss the data science landscape based on her experience working with over 500 Insight alumni, who are now data scientists and data engineers at over 100 companies and nonprofits, including Facebook, Apple, Google, Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, The New York Times, NBC, Khan Academy, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and the Broad Institute.</p>

<p>
The Insight Fellows Program is a training fellowship for graduate students and postdocs designed to bridge the gap between academia and a career in data science and engineering. Insight provides seven-week, full-time, postdoctoral training fellowships in Silicon Valley, New York City, and Boston. It offers full-tuition scholarships, dedicated office space, and self-directed, project-based learning under the guidance of top industry mentors.</p>

<p>
Kathy Copic is the director of growth at Insight Data Science. Before Insight, she worked in experimental particle physics at labs including CERN, Fermilab, SLAC and CESR. She earned her Ph.D. in physics at the University of Michigan working on CDF, was a postdoc at Columbia on ATLAS, and was a staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab working with ATLAS and the Particle Data Group. <a href="http://insightdatascience.com">

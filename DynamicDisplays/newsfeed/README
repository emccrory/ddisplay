The files in this folder were an attempt to hack a newsfeed scroll at the bottom of the displays.

This did some fairly fragile text matching to scrape the new text from an RSS feed.

This was abandoned in early 2018.

If this were to be somthing that others would like to continue, I recommend that it starts with a well-tested XML interpreter.

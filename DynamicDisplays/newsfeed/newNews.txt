<b> Fermilab video conferencing monthly maintenance</b>:  The Core Computing Division is initiating a standard monthly maintenance window to update the Fermilab video conference equipment infrastructure. Fermilab video conference calls (IP, not phone) may drop during the maintenance window, at which point you should attempt to reconnect to the video conference system. The maintenance window will take place on the first Tuesday of every month from approximately 8:30 to 9:15 a.m. Central starting on Tuesday, March 1. Please submit a Service Desk request if you cannot reconnect... <a class="more-link" href="http://news.fnal.gov/2016/02/fermilab-video-conferencing-monthly-maintenance/">  More &#187;</a>  
<b> Improve your science communication skills March 1 or March 2 at 8:30 in Ramsey Auditorium</b>:  The experts from the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University will present two one-hour plenary, interactive sessions on improving your science communication skills. Anyone looking to improve their skills is invited to attend either session on Tuesday, March 1, or Wednesday, March 2, from 8:30 to 9:30 in Ramsey Auditorium. During the sessions, Alan Alda Center staff will discuss the challenges of communicating to different audiences, use interactive examples to touch on jargon in science communication... <a class="more-link" href="http://news.fnal.gov/2016/02/improve-science-communication-skills-march-1-march-2-830-ramsey-auditorium/">  More &#187;</a>  
<b> Einstein in chalk</b>:  Find this chalk portrait of Einstein, drawn by Fermilab guest scientist Ao Liu, on the 13th floor of Wilson Hall at 1323. There’s no high-tech here: just good, old-fashioned chalk as the medium. Einstein is located next to a chalk drawing of Richard Feynman. 
<b> DZero discovers new tetraquark particle</b>:  From <em>Gizmodo</em>, Feb. 25. 2016: Physicists from the DZero collaboration have announced the discovery of a new particle, believed to be part of an exotic family called “tetraquarks.” 
<b> January PAC report now online</b>:  The Physics Advisory Committee has considered the future neutrino program (LBNF/DUNE and the Short-Baseline Neutrino Program), NOvA, MicroBooNE, MINOS+, US-CMS, the Scientific Computing Division status and vision, and the theory strategic plan. 
<b> LPC celebrates Joel Butler’s election as spokesperson for CMS</b>:  Check out photos from the party. 
<b> URA Thesis Award competition</b>:  Fermilab and the Universities Research Association invite submissions for the nineteenth annual URA Thesis Award competition. Nominations must be submitted to Lenny Spiegel at lenny@fnal.gov by March 18, 2016 and should include two letters supporting the merits of the thesis being nominated. At least one letter should be from a member of the thesis committee of the PhD granting institution and, for work carried out in collaboration with Fermilab scientists, at least one of the letters should come from one... <a class="more-link" href="http://news.fnal.gov/2016/02/ura-thesis-award-competition-2/">  More &#187;</a>

<b> Looking forward</b>:  Which directions do postcollision electrons take at the Large Hadron Collider, and how often do they go one way versus another? The answer gives a way to probe electroweak theory. 
<b> Seeing clearly with electron neutrinos</b>:  NOvA announces its first cross section measurement, the probability than an electron neutrino interacts with the protons and neutrons inside the NOvA near detector. The measurement draws on the largest data set in the electron neutrino energy region from 1 GeV to 3 GeV.

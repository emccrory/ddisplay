<![CDATA[Long ago, U.S. business learned the benefits of constantly soliciting advice from workers on the shop floor by studying the startling success of the Japanese automobile industry. But the vast majority of U.S. school districts have remained hierarchical operations that ignore the wisdom available from their best classroom teachers. After decades of failed top-down solutions, now is the time to create a massive national movement that empowers and deeply respects our teachers. Scientists and science teachers can lead the way.

<![CDATA[A team of astronomers has found a gas cloud that existed when the universe was 13% of its current age that appears to be made of the pristine gas produced in the big bang but with just a wisp of heavier elements: 1/3000 of the level in our solar system. This tiny impurity suggests that it contains the ashes of some of the very first generation of stars. These primordial stars, which first formed about 150 million years after the big bang, were unlike any today. With masses a hundred times or more that of our sun, they burned hot and fast, forging hydrogen into heavier elements in their fusion furnaces then spewing them out into space when they exploded at the end of their lives. Astronomers are just beginning to be able to study this process, which ultimately produced the materials for planets and life.

<![CDATA[If you watch cable TV news or listen to NPR, you've likely been barraged with ads for Lumosity, a set of digital "brain-training" games that purportedly sharpens the mind based on the "science of neuroplasticity." Last week, Lumosity hit the news for a different reason, as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) made it the latest target in a crackdown on companies selling products that purportedly enhance memory, provide some other cognitive benefit, or reduce the serious side effects of dementia. It fined the games' maker, Lumos Labs, Inc., $2 million for false advertising and required it to create a pop-up screen that alerts players to FTC's order and allows them to avoid future billing. It's the third FTC complaint against the industry in 4 months, and many neuroscientists and psychologists say action is long overdue. Still, some worry that games based on solid science may be unfairly tarnished, and that the agency may be imposing a standard of evidence that game developers can't meet.

<![CDATA[If you are a Williams or Johnson—among the most common surnames in the United States—it can be tricky to find you on the Internet, especially if you also have a common first name such as Mary or James. For academic researchers, whose careers are measured largely by authorship on papers, name ambiguity can be a killer. Some clarity, however, is now in sight. In a letter released online 7 January, some of the world's largest academic publishers and scientific societies announced that they will not just encourage, but ultimately require, researchers to sign up with ORCID, a nonprofit organization that assigns members a 16-digit identifier.

<![CDATA[For decades biologists have marveled at the diversity of penises across the animal kingdom. But in anatomy, as in other fields, females are getting more credit. At a recent symposium ostensibly about the male organ, the complexity of some female genitalia and their role in shaping phallic diversity stole the show. Researchers studying whales, snakes, and other animals are finding that female sex organs have some of the same baroque complexity seen in males. They now see females as active participants in an arms race, likely evolving more complex genitalia to control mating and to create barriers against forced matings—which in turn leads to male countermeasures. They called for more intense looks at how the sex organs interact during copulation and proposed new methods for measuring these organs.

<![CDATA[Incandescent light bulbs have changed little since Thomas Edison perfected them in 1878. But now, researchers report that they've tripled the efficiency of an incandescent, making it nearly as efficient as a commercial LED. They did so by reworking the light bulb's metal light emitter into a flat sheet and flanking it on either side with nanostructured mirrors. The mirrors allow visible light to pass through, but they reflect infrared light back to the emitter, where it's absorbed and some of the energy is re-emitted as visible light. The researchers now hope to improve their mirrors to make their new-age incandescents far more efficient than today's best LEDs and compact fluorescents. That could save energy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, while still giving us the warm, yellowish white glow we love from incandescent lights.

<![CDATA[The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena has suspended a faculty member for gender-based harassment. The university has not disclosed the name of the faculty member, but Science has learned that it is Christian Ott, a professor of theoretical astrophysics who studies gravitational waves and other signals from some of the most violent events in the cosmos. In what is believed to be a first such action by the university, the researcher has been stripped of his Caltech salary and barred from campus for 1 year, is undergoing personalized coaching to become a better mentor, and will need to prove that he has been rehabilitated before he can resume advising students without supervision. Caltech has not curtailed his research activities. The case surfaces as harassment has become a major flashpoint within the astronomy community and even within Congress.

<![CDATA[Particle physicists at Europe's CERN laboratory in Switzerland say they have observed bizarre new cousins of the protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nucleus. Protons and neutrons consist of other particles called quarks, bound by the strong nuclear force. By smashing particles at high energies, physicists have blasted into fleeting existence hundreds of other quark-containing particles. Until recently, all contained either two or three quarks. But since 2014, researchers working with CERN's Large Hadron Collider have also spotted four- and five-quark particles. Such tetraquarks and pentaquarks could require physicists to rethink their understanding of quantum chromodynamics, or they could have less revolutionary implications. Researchers hope that computer simulations and more collider studies will reveal how the oddball newcomers are put together, but some wonder whether experiments will ever provide a definitive answer.

<![CDATA[When the Nicaraguan government vowed in 2012 to revive a long-dormant idea to carve a canal through the heart of the country, scientists expected a national debate on the project's merits. More than three times as long and twice as deep as the recently enlarged Panama Canal, the $40 billion Grand Canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans would be the largest civil earthmoving project in history, with a social and environmental footprint to match. But in June 2013, when Nicaragua's government asked its National Assembly to grant a 50-year concession for the canal to a Chinese firm, approval took just 2 days. Now, after the release of a massive impact assessment of the project, and just months before the company says it will break ground, the debate has begun in earnest.

<![CDATA[In the late 19th century, Robert Koch established his famous postulates as stringent guidelines to evaluate causation in infectious disease (1). These original postulates require isolation of the putative pathogen and reinfection of a healthy host to prove causation. Over the years, Koch's postulates have been continually restated to incorporate the latest scientific findings and technologies (2–5). Modern molecular techniques have demonstrated that current or previous members of a microbial community can affect disease outcome, providing a nuanced view of strict causation as originally proposed by Koch. There is thus a need to incorporate microbial communities into rigorous modern guidelines for evaluating disease causation.

<![CDATA[A growing body of evidence shows that so-called long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) often produce short peptides from small open reading frames (s mORFs) (1). Whether and how smORF-encoded peptides fulfill specific functions remain poorly understood. Recent studies in flies (2) and mammals (3) have revealed that transcripts annotated as lncRNAs encode smORF peptides that bind to, and inhibit, the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA), an ion pump that is a key player in handling calcium in striated muscles. On page 271 of this issue, Nelson et al. (4) report that a lncRNA-encoded small peptide competes with SERCA-inhibitory peptides, thereby favoring heart contractility in mammals. These findings open new ways to understand cardiac function and pathologies, and show that smORF peptides act as versatile regulators of protein activity.

<description>
<![CDATA[All cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have a 7-methylguanosine (m7GpppN) cap structure at their 5′ ends, which promotes efficient translation and mRNA stability. The cap is recognized by the translation initiation factor eIF4F. eIF4F recruits the 40S small ribosomal subunit near the mRNA cap, which then scans the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) toward the initiation codon for subsequent protein synthesis. In conditions of stress or during viral infections, cap-dependent translation is compromised. Internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) can bypass the cap to recruit ribosomes internally to the transcript, helping to secure appropriate protein synthesis under such conditions. On page 240 of this issue, Weingarten-Gabbay et al. (1) report the systematic discovery of cellular and viral IRESs, identifying a substantial fraction of mRNAs (∼10%) and viruses (∼20%) with the potential to be translated by this cap-independent mechanism.

<![CDATA[Plasmons (1) are collective density oscillations that pertain to charged particles, such as electrons and holes in solids. Although plasmons are often associated with metals, they are being actively explored for graphene and related two-dimensional materials (2DMs). Graphene plasmons (GPs) (2) can achieve active functionalities in diverse device types. For example, mid-infrared (mid-IR) GPs have been used to enhance mid-IR photodetectors (3), vibrational sensing of surface-adsorbed polymers (4), and label-free detection of protein monolayers (5). On page 246 of this issue, Chakraborty et al. (6) show that tunable graphene optical properties and GPs can be used to modulate the emission of a terahertz (THz) quantum cascade laser (7). Electromagnetic waves in the THz range (frequencies ν between 0.3 and 10 THz, or wavelengths γ between 50 µm and 1 mm) can penetrate many materials and have many applications in imaging and spectroscopy.

<![CDATA[In H. G. Wells' 1901 science fiction classic The First Men in the Moon, two protagonists, English businessman Mr. Bedford and the eccentric physicist Dr. Cavor, knock back a special enervating concoction designed to expand their lungs, followed by the requisite fortifying brandy, before venturing onto the Moon's surface to breathe the rarefied lunar atmosphere. Even more tenuous than Wells' imagined environment, the lunar exosphere is an atmosphere so thin that atoms never collide, bounded on one side by the lunar surface and extending thousands of kilometers out into space. This low-density envelope results from a balance among the influx of material from the Sun, outgassing from the Moon's interior, delivery from meteoritic bombardment, and the loss of material to space as well as recycling in the lunar surface (see the figure). The precise formula for the formation of the lunar exosphere is unknown, but recent data from orbital spacecraft are being used to delineate the relative contributions from different processes. On page 249 of this issue, Colaprete et al. (1) report measurements of sodium and potassium (Na and K) in the lunar exosphere based on observations from the Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrometer (UVS) aboard NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), which acquired continuous dayside and nightside measurements of exospheric Na and K over multiple lunar orbits.

<![CDATA[Economists like to assert that humans are cool calculators of maximal utility, considering all options, then deciding on a course of action that leads to the best outcome possible. In this light, it seems puzzling that the news is chock full of reports of people who seem to violate this presumption, sometimes violently. Why We Snap by R. Douglas Fields attempts to explain the seeming paradox from the perspective of neuroscience. In doing so, the book nicely illustrates an irony of evolution: Much of what evolved to keep us safe can get us into serious trouble in the modern world.

<![CDATA[In Orphan, Philip R. Reilly chronicles the quest to end a particular subset of human diseases that arise when our DNA goes awry. Retracing roads to successful treatments and providingsuggestions for the next trails to be blazed, Orphan is "a magnificent gift" to the parents, physicians, and scientists who strive to improve the lives of children born with rare genetic disorders.

<![CDATA[Comin et al. (Reports, 20 March 2015, p. 1335) have interpreted their resonant x-ray scattering experiment as indicating that charge inhomogeneities in the family of high-temperature superconductors YBa2Cu3O6+y (YBCO) have the character of one-dimensional stripes rather than two-dimensional checkerboards. The present Comment shows that one cannot distinguish between stripes and checkerboards on the basis of the above experiment.

<![CDATA[Fine questions our interpretation of unidirectional stripes over a bidirectional checkerboard and illustrates his criticism by simulating a momentum space structure consistent with our data and corresponding to a checkerboard-looking real space density. Here, we use a local rotational-symmetry analysis to demonstrate that the simulated image is actually composed of locally unidirectional modulations of the charge density, consistent with our original conclusions.

<description>
<![CDATA[Viruses that infect the intestine include major human pathogens (retroviruses, noroviruses, rotaviruses, astroviruses, picornaviruses, adenoviruses, herpesviruses) that constitute a serious public health problem worldwide. These viral pathogens are members of a large, complex viral community inhabiting the intestine termed “the enteric virome.” Enteric viruses have intimate functional and genetic relationships with both the host and other microbial constituents that inhabit the intestine, such as the bacterial microbiota, their associated phages, helminthes, and fungi, which together constitute the microbiome. Emerging data indicate that enteric viruses regulate, and are in turn regulated by, these other microbes through a series of processes termed “transkingdom interactions.” This represents a changing paradigm in intestinal immunity to viral infection. Here we review recent advances in the field and propose new ways in which to conceptualize this important area.

<description>
<![CDATA[To investigate gene specificity at the level of translation in both the human genome and viruses, we devised a high-throughput bicistronic assay to quantify cap-independent translation. We uncovered thousands of novel cap-independent translation sequences, and we provide insights on the landscape of translational regulation in both humans and viruses. We find extensive translational elements in the 3′ untranslated region of human transcripts and the polyprotein region of uncapped RNA viruses. Through the characterization of regulatory elements underlying cap-independent translation activity, we identify potential mechanisms of secondary structure, short sequence motif, and base pairing with the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Furthermore, we systematically map the 18S rRNA regions for which reverse complementarity enhances translation. Thus, we make available insights into the mechanisms of translational control in humans and viruses.

<![CDATA[To optimize drug candidates, modern medicinal chemists are increasingly turning to an unconventional structural motif: small, strained ring systems. However, the difficulty of introducing substituents such as bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes, azetidines, or cyclobutanes often outweighs the challenge of synthesizing the parent scaffold itself. Thus, there is an urgent need for general methods to rapidly and directly append such groups onto core scaffolds. Here we report a general strategy to harness the embedded potential energy of effectively spring-loaded C–C and C–N bonds with the most oft-encountered nucleophiles in pharmaceutical chemistry, amines. Strain-release amination can diversify a range of substrates with a multitude of desirable bioisosteres at both the early and late stages of a synthesis. The technique has also been applied to peptide labeling and bioconjugation.

<![CDATA[Two-dimensional graphene plasmon-based technologies will enable the development of fast, compact, and inexpensive active photonic elements because, unlike plasmons in other materials, graphene plasmons can be tuned via the doping level. Such tuning is harnessed within terahertz quantum cascade lasers to reversibly alter their emission. This is achieved in two key steps: first, by exciting graphene plasmons within an aperiodic lattice laser and, second, by engineering photon lifetimes, linking graphene’s Fermi energy with the round-trip gain. Modal gain and hence laser spectra are highly sensitive to the doping of an integrated, electrically controllable, graphene layer. Demonstration of the integrated graphene plasmon laser principle lays the foundation for a new generation of active, programmable plasmonic metamaterials with major implications across photonics, material sciences, and nanotechnology.

<![CDATA[Despite being trace constituents of the lunar exosphere, sodium and potassium are the most readily observed species due to their bright line emission. Measurements of these species by the Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrometer (UVS) on the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) have revealed unambiguous temporal and spatial variations indicative of a strong role for meteoroid bombardment and surface composition in determining the composition and local time dependence of the Moon’s exosphere. Observations show distinct lunar day (monthly) cycles for both species as well as an annual cycle for sodium. The first continuous measurements for potassium show a more repeatable variation across lunations and an enhancement over KREEP (Potassium Rare Earth Elements and Phosphorus) surface regions, revealing a strong dependence on surface composition.

<![CDATA[Proximity-driven metalation has been extensively exploited to achieve reactivity and selectivity in carbon–hydrogen (C–H) bond activation. Despite the substantial improvement in developing more efficient and practical directing groups, their stoichiometric installation and removal limit efficiency and, often, applicability as well. Here we report the development of an amino acid reagent that reversibly reacts with aldehydes and ketones in situ via imine formation to serve as a transient directing group for activation of inert C–H bonds. Arylation of a wide range of aldehydes and ketones at the β or γ positions proceeds in the presence of a palladium catalyst and a catalytic amount of amino acid. The feasibility of achieving enantioselective C–H activation reactions using a chiral amino acid as the transient directing group is also demonstrated.

<![CDATA[We report the discovery of ASASSN-15lh (SN 2015L), which we interpret as the most luminous supernova yet found. At redshift z = 0.2326, ASASSN-15lh reached an absolute magnitude of Mu,AB = –23.5 ± 0.1 and bolometric luminosity Lbol = (2.2 ± 0.2) × 1045 ergs s–1, which is more than twice as luminous as any previously known supernova. It has several major features characteristic of the hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe-I), whose energy sources and progenitors are currently poorly understood. In contrast to most previously known SLSNe-I that reside in star-forming dwarf galaxies, ASASSN-15lh appears to be hosted by a luminous galaxy (MK ≈ –25.5) with little star formation. In the 4 months since first detection, ASASSN-15lh radiated (1.1 ± 0.2) × 1052 ergs, challenging the magnetar model for its engine.

<![CDATA[Archaeological evidence for human dispersal through northern Eurasia before 40,000 years ago is rare. In west Siberia, the northernmost find of that age is located at 57°N. Elsewhere, the earliest presence of humans in the Arctic is commonly thought to be circa 35,000 to 30,000 years before the present. A mammoth kill site in the central Siberian Arctic, dated to 45,000 years before the present, expands the populated area to almost 72°N. The advancement of mammoth hunting probably allowed people to survive and spread widely across northernmost Arctic Siberia.

<![CDATA[Solar radiation absorbed by marine phytoplankton can follow three possible paths. By simultaneously measuring the quantum yields of photochemistry and chlorophyll fluorescence in situ, we calculate that, on average, ~60% of absorbed photons are converted to heat, only 35% are directed toward photochemical water splitting, and the rest are reemitted as fluorescence. The spatial pattern of fluorescence yields and lifetimes strongly suggests that photochemical energy conversion is physiologically limited by nutrients. Comparison of in situ fluorescence lifetimes with satellite retrievals of solar-induced fluorescence yields suggests that the mean values of the latter are generally representative of the photophysiological state of phytoplankton; however, the signal-to-noise ratio is unacceptably low in extremely oligotrophic regions, which constitute 30% of the open ocean.

<![CDATA[Vocal imitation involves incorporating instructive auditory information into relevant motor circuits through processes that are poorly understood. In zebra finches, we found that exposure to a tutor’s song drives spiking activity within premotor neurons in the juvenile, whereas inhibition suppresses such responses upon learning in adulthood. We measured inhibitory currents evoked by the tutor song throughout development while simultaneously quantifying each bird’s learning trajectory. Surprisingly, we found that the maturation of synaptic inhibition onto premotor neurons is correlated with learning but not age. We used synthetic tutoring to demonstrate that inhibition is selective for specific song elements that have already been learned and not those still in refinement. Our results suggest that structured inhibition plays a crucial role during song acquisition, enabling a piece-by-piece mastery of complex tasks.

<![CDATA[Muscle contraction depends on release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and reuptake by the Ca2+adenosine triphosphatase SERCA. We discovered a putative muscle-specific long noncoding RNA that encodes a peptide of 34 amino acids and that we named dwarf open reading frame (DWORF). DWORF localizes to the SR membrane, where it enhances SERCA activity by displacing the SERCA inhibitors, phospholamban, sarcolipin, and myoregulin. In mice, overexpression of DWORF in cardiomyocytes increases peak Ca2+ transient amplitude and SR Ca2+ load while reducing the time constant of cytosolic Ca2+ decay during each cycle of contraction-relaxation. Conversely, slow skeletal muscle lacking DWORF exhibits delayed Ca2+ clearance and relaxation and reduced SERCA activity. DWORF is the only endogenous peptide known to activate the SERCA pump by physical interaction and provides a means for enhancing muscle contractility.

<![CDATA[Mitochondria undergo fragmentation in response to electron transport chain (ETC) poisons and mitochondrial DNA–linked disease mutations, yet how these stimuli mechanistically connect to the mitochondrial fission and fusion machinery is poorly understood. We found that the energy-sensing adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase (AMPK) is genetically required for cells to undergo rapid mitochondrial fragmentation after treatment with ETC inhibitors. Moreover, direct pharmacological activation of AMPK was sufficient to rapidly promote mitochondrial fragmentation even in the absence of mitochondrial stress. A screen for substrates of AMPK identified mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), a mitochondrial outer-membrane receptor for DRP1, the cytoplasmic guanosine triphosphatase that catalyzes mitochondrial fission. Nonphosphorylatable and phosphomimetic alleles of the AMPK sites in MFF revealed that it is a key effector of AMPK-mediated mitochondrial fission.

<![CDATA[Hydroxymethylcytosine, well described in DNA, occurs also in RNA. Here, we show that hydroxymethylcytosine preferentially marks polyadenylated RNAs and is deposited by Tet in Drosophila. We map the transcriptome-wide hydroxymethylation landscape, revealing hydroxymethylcytosine in the transcripts of many genes, notably in coding sequences, and identify consensus sites for hydroxymethylation. We found that RNA hydroxymethylation can favor mRNA translation. Tet and hydroxymethylated RNA are found to be most abundant in the Drosophila brain, and Tet-deficient fruitflies suffer impaired brain development, accompanied by decreased RNA hydroxymethylation. This study highlights the distribution, localization, and function of cytosine hydroxymethylation and identifies central roles for this modification in Drosophila.

<![CDATA[Genes encoding human β-type globin undergo a developmental switch from embryonic to fetal to adult-type expression. Mutations in the adult form cause inherited hemoglobinopathies or globin disorders, including sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Some experimental results have suggested that these diseases could be treated by induction of fetal-type hemoglobin (HbF). However, the mechanisms that repress HbF in adults remain unclear. We found that the LRF/ZBTB7A transcription factor occupies fetal γ-globin genes and maintains the nucleosome density necessary for γ-globin gene silencing in adults, and that LRF confers its repressive activity through a NuRD repressor complex independent of the fetal globin repressor BCL11A. Our study may provide additional opportunities for therapeutic targeting in the treatment of hemoglobinopathies.

<![CDATA[This webinar is the fifth in a series focusing on the cancer pathways that support tumor development, the emerging research in identifying and targeting these pathways, and innovations in the development of increasingly effective cancer therapy options. Recent advances in our understanding of cancer have revealed that the disease cannot be understood through simple analysis of genetic mutations within cancerous cells. Instead, tumors should be considered as complex tissues in which the cancer cells communicate directly and indirectly with the surrounding cellular microenvironment and evolve traits that promote their own survival. In this webinar, we will explore how tumors exploit immune modulatory mechanisms to generate and thrive in their own immunosuppressive microenvironment. Further, we will examine how these mechanisms can be targeted to develop better therapeutic options.View the Webinar

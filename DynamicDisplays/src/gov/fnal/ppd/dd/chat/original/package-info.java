/**
 * <p>
 * Fermilab's Dynamic Displays System -- The classes from which I derived the chat classes, left here because I have needed this
 * reference more than once, over the years.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * These files were taken from
 * <a href="http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/259777-a-simple-chat-program-with-clientserver-gui-optional/">dreamincode.net
 * </a> on 5/12/2014.</a>
 *
 * <p>
 * It implements a simple, GUI-based client/server chat mechanism.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The code here is taken exactly from this web site, except that the class names have been changed (Prepended with "Orig_", where
 * necessary) to avoid confusion elsewhere.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A second, somewhat simpler example was taken from https://way2java.com/networking/chat-program-two-way-communication/. This is
 * the classes that begin with "Gossip"
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In order to clean up ALL compile warnings in this suite, I have added "@SupressWarning" messages in these classes.

 * Fermilab's Dynamic Displays System -- A clean and simple attempt, copied from the Internet, to do Publish/Subscribe
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This was created September 2021. Note that the first attempt was implemented by hand, by me, in the MessagingServer, 
 * in around 2018. It is likely that that first attempt was not a great implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is untested. And it is not sophisticated enough to use for our system, but it might be a start.

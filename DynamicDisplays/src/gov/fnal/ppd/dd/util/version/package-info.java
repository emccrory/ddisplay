 * The classes that define the version numbers in the suite. Long story short: the version number is of the form A.B.C, where A, B
 * and C are non-negative integers.
 * </p>
 * </p>
 * It also has classes to read and to set these version numbers. Those version numbers can be on the local disk and they can be in
 * the database. These are both useful.
